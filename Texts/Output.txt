489: Ham. Hark you, guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
490: Ham. Haste me to know't, that i, with wings as swift
491: Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
492: Ham. Hear you, sir!
493: Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
494: Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
495: Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's gonzago.
496: Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
497: Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned dane,
498: Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his majesty shall
499: Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
500: Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
501: Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
502: Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
503: Ham. Hold off your hands!
504: Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
505: Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
506: Ham. How came he mad?
507: Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
508: Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
509: Ham. How does the queen?
510: Ham. How if i answer no?
511: Ham. How is it with you, lady?
512: Ham. How long is that since?
513: Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
514: Ham. How purpos'd, sir, i pray you?
515: Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
516: Ham. How strangely?
517: Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly i
518: Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure.
519: Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
520: Ham. I am glad to see you well.
521: Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
522: Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
523: Ham. I am very glad to see you. - [to bernardo] good even, sir. -
524: Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if i could see
525: Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
526: Ham. I do beseech you.
527: Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into france i have been in
528: Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
529: Ham. I embrace it freely,
530: Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
531: Ham. If she should break it now!
532: Ham. If thou dost marry, i'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
533: Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
534: Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
535: Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [aside to horatio] dost know this
536: Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
537: Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
538: Ham. I'll be your foil, laertes. In mine ignorance
539: Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
540: Ham. I lov'd ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
541: Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
542: Ham. I must to england; you know that?
543: Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
544: Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
545: Ham. In happy time.
546: Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
547: Ham. In my mind's eye, horatio.
548: Ham. In the secret parts of fortune? O! Most true! She is a
549: Ham. Into my grave?
550: Ham. I pray you.
551: Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
552: Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for england!
553: Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
554: Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
555: Ham. Is't possible?
556: Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
557: Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
558: Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of denmark, and
559: Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard. - prithee say on.
560: Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
561: Ham. It waves me still.
562: Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
563: Ham. It will not speak. Then will i follow it.
564: Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
565: Ham. I will.
566: Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it. -
567: Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
568: Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
569: Ham. I will watch to-night.
570: Ham. I would i had been there.
571: Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
572: Ham. Judgment!
573: Ham. Lady, shall i lie in your lap?
574: Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
575: Ham. Let me see. [takes the skull. ] alas, poor yorick! I knew him,
576: Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
577: Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
578: Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
579: Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
580: Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
581: Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
582: Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
583: Ham. Murther?
584: Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, guildenstern? Ah,
585: Ham. My fate cries out
586: Ham. My lord, i have news to tell you. When roscius was an actor in
587: Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
588: Ham. Nay, but swear't.
589: Ham. Nay, but to live
590: Ham. Nay come! Again! The queen falls.
591: Ham. Nay, do not think i flatter;
592: Ham. Nay, i know not.
593: Ham. Nay, i know not. Is it the king?
594: Ham. Nay, that follows not.
595: Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
596: Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
597: Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
598: Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
599: Ham. No, by this bad.
600: Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
601: Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
602: Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
603: Ham. No, nor mine now. [to polonius] my lord, you play'd once
604: Ham. No, not i!
605: Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
606: Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
607: Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
608: Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
609: Ham. Nothing.
610: Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
611: Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
612: Ham. Not this, by no means, that i bid you do:
613: Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
614: Ham. Now might i do it pat, now he is praying;
615: Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
616: Ham. No, you will reveal it.
617: Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
618: Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
619: Ham. Of him, sir.
620: Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
621: Ham. O god, i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
622: Ham. O god, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
623: Ham. O good horatio, i'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
624: Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! Most horrible!
625: Ham. O, i die, horatio!
626: Ham. O jephthah, judge of israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
627: Ham. O my prophetic soul!
628: Ham. One.
629: Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
630: Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
631: Ham. Or like a whale.
632: Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'good morrow, sweet lord!
633: Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
634: Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
635: Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
636: Ham. Pale or red?
637: Ham. Safely stow'd.
638: Ham. Saw? Who?
639: Ham. Seems, madam, nay, it is. I know not 'seems. '
640: Ham. She well instructs me.
641: Ham. Sir, a whole history.
642: Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, i
643: Ham. Sir, i cannot.
644: Ham. Sir, i lack advancement.
645: Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
646: Ham. Sir, i will walk here in the hall. If it please his majesty,
647: Ham. Sir, my good friend- i'll change that name with you.
648: Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
649: Ham. So be it!
650: Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for i'll have a
651: Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
652: Ham. So you must take your husbands. - begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
653: Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
654: Ham. Speak the speech, i pray you, as i pronounc'd it to you,
655: Ham. Such an act
656: Ham. That i can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
657: Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
658: Ham. That is laertes,
659: Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
660: Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
661: Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
662: Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
663: Ham. The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
664: Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
665: Ham. The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
666: Ham. The king my father?
667: Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
668: Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
669: Ham. Then i would you were so honest a man.
670: Ham. Then saw you not his face?
671: Ham. Then will i come to my mother by-and-by. - they fool me to the
672: Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
673: Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
674: Ham. The point envenom'd too?
675: Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
676: Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
677: Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all denmark
678: Ham. These tedious old fools!
679: Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
680: Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
681: Ham. This?
682: Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
683: Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'tis for
684: Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
685: Ham. Thrift, thrift, horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
686: Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
687: Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
688: Ham. To what base uses we may return, horatio! Why may not
689: Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
690: Ham. Up from my cabin,
691: Ham. Upon my sword.
692: Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
693: Ham. Upon what ground?
694: Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
695: Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
696: Ham. Very well, my lord.
697: Ham. Well, god-a-mercy.
698: Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
699: Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
700: Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
701: Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
702: Ham. What?
703: Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
704: Ham. What call you the carriages?
705: Ham. What did you enact?
706: Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
707: Ham. What, ho, horatio!
708: Ham. What hour now?
709: Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
710: Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
711: Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
712: Ham. What's his weapon?
713: Ham. What's the matter now?
714: Ham. What, the fair ophelia?
715: Ham. What woman then?
716: Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
717: Ham. Who commands them, sir?
718: Ham. Who, i?
719: Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
720: Ham. Whose was it?
721: Ham. Why?
722: Ham. Why,
723: Ham. Why,
724: Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
725: Ham. Why did you laugh then, when i said 'man delights not me'?
726: Ham. Why, e'en so! And now my lady worm's, chapless, and knock'd
727: Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
728: Ham. Why he more than another?
729: Ham. Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
730: Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
731: Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
732: Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
733: Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
734: Ham. Why, then the polack never will defend it.
735: Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
736: Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
737: Ham. With drink, sir?
738: Ham. Words, words, words.
739: Ham. Yes, by saint patrick, but there is, horatio,
740: Ham. You are welcome.
741: Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that i will more
742: Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
743: Ham. Yours, yours. [exit osric. ] he does well to commend it
744: Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
745: Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
746: Ham. [aside] nay then, i have an eye of you. - if you love me, hold
747: Ham. [aside to horatio] thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
748: Ham. [aside] wormwood, wormwood!
749: Ham. 'by-and-by' is easily said. - leave me, friends.
750: Ham. [comes forward] what is he whose grief
751: Ham. [draws] how now? A rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
752: Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
753: Hamlet in madness hath polonius slain,
754: Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
755: Ham. 'swounds, show me what thou't do.
756: Ham. 'the mousetrap. ' marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
757: Ham. 'tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
758: Ham. 'tis very strange.
759: Ham. 'tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon. -
760: Ham. (within) mother, mother, mother!
761: Haply the seas, and countries different,
762: He closes thus: 'i know the gentleman.
763: He is gone, he is gone,
764: Help, help, ho!
765: He may not, as unvalued persons do,
766: He never gave commandment for their death.
767: Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
768: Here, hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
769: Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
770: Here's yet some liquor left.
771: Her father and myself (lawful espials)
772: Her mood will needs be pitied.
773: He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
774: He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
775: He took my father grossly, full of bread,
776: His beard was as white as snow,
777: His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
778: His liberty is full of threats to all-
779: His means of death, his obscure funeral-
780: Hold you the watch to-night?
781: Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
782: Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
783: Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
784: Hor. A piece of him.
785: Hor. As i do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
786: Hor. As thou art to thyself.
787: Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
788: Hor. Ay, good my lord.

812: Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
813: Hor. In faith,

815: Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
816: Hor. Is it a custom?
817: Hor. Is't possible?
818: Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
819: Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
820: Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
821: Hor. It might, my lord.
822: Hor. It must be shortly known to him from england
823: Hor. It was, as i have seen it in his life,
824: Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
825: Hor. I warr'nt it will.
826: Hor. Let him bless thee too.
827: Hor. Let them come in.
828: Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!

833: Hor. My lord, i think i saw him yesternight.
834: Hor. My lord, the king your father.
835: Hor. Nay, good my lord -
836: Hor. Nay, very pale.
837: Hor. Never believe it.
838: Hor. No, by no means!

859: Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
860: Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

918: If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
919: If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, i will do
920: If that his majesty would aught with us,
921: If there be any good thing to be done,
922: If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
923: If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
924: If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
925: If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
926: If you do meet horatio and marcellus,
927: I had my father's signet in my purse,
928: I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
929: I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
930: I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the french,
931: I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
932: I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
933: I'll cross it, though it blast me. - stay illusion!
934: I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
935: I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. -
936: I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
937: I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
938: Imperious caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
939: I must be cruel, only to be kind;
940: I never gave you aught.
941: In the corrupted currents of this world
942: In thee there is not half an hour of life.
943: In the most high and palmy state of rome,
944: In youth when i did love, did love,
945: I once did hold it, as our statists do,
946: I pray thee stay with us, go not to wittenberg.
947: I pray you go with me.
948: I pray you, now receive them.
949: I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
950: I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
951: I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
952: I shall not look upon his like again.
953: Is it not monstrous that this player here,
954: Is not this something more than fantasy?
955: I stay too long. But here my father comes.
956: It had been so with us, had we been there.
957: I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
958: It is a poison temper'd by himself.
959: It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
960: I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
961: It warms the very sickness in my heart
962: It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
963: It will be laid to us, whose providence
964: It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
965: I will bestow him, and will answer well
966: I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
967: King. Alas, alas!
968: King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
969: King. A norman.
970: King. Arm you, i pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
971: King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
972: King. At supper? Where?
973: King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
974: King. Ay, hamlet.
975: King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
976: King. Bring him before us.
977: King. But how hath she
978: King. But where is he?
979: King. Come, hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
980: King. Conceit upon her father.
981: King. Dead.
982: King. Do you think 'tis this?
983: King. Faith, i must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
984: King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
985: King. From hamlet? Who brought them?
986: King. Full thirty times hath phoebus' cart gone round
987: King. Gertrude, do not drink.
988: King. Give me some light! Away!
989: King. Give them the foils, young osric. Cousin hamlet,
990: King. Good laertes,
991: King. Go seek him there. [to attendants. ]
992: King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
993: King. Have you your father's leave? What says polonius?
994: King. He made confession of you;
995: King. How do you, pretty lady?
996: King. How fares our cousin hamlet?
997: King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
998: King. How may we try it further?
999: King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
1000: King. I do not fear it, i have seen you both;
1001: King. I do not think't.
1002: King. I have nothing with this answer, hamlet. These words are not
1003: King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
1004: King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
1005: King. I pray thee, good horatio, wait upon him.
1006: King. It falls right.
1007: King. It likes us well;
1008: King. It shall be so.
1009: King. Laertes, i must commune with your grief,
1010: King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
1011: King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
1012: King. Let him demand his fill.
1013: King. Let's follow, gertrude.
1014: King. Let's further think of this,
1015: King. Love? His affections do not that way tend;
1016: King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
1017: King. Not that i know.
1018: King. Not that i think you did not love your father;
1019: King. Now, hamlet, where's polonius?
1020: King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
1021: King. O, for two special reasons,
1022: King. O gertrude, come away!
1023: King. O heavy deed!
1024: King. O, he is mad, laertes.
1025: King. O, speak of that! That do i long to hear.
1026: King. Our son shall win.
1027: King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
1028: King. Part them! They are incens'd.
1029: King. Pluck thein asunder.
1030: King. Pretty ophelia!
1031: King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
1032: King. She sounds to see them bleed.
1033: King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
1034: King. So you shall;
1035: King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
1036: King. Sweet gertrude, leave us too;
1037: King. Take thy fair hour, laertes. Time be thine,
1038: King. Thanks, dear my lord.
1039: King. Thanks, rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern.
1040: King. The doors are broke.
1041: King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
1042: King. The very same.
1043: King. Though yet of hamlet our dear brother's death
1044: King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
1045: King. Thy loving father, hamlet.
1046: King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
1047: King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
1048: King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
1049: King. Welcome, dear rosencrantz and guildenstern.
1050: King. Well, we shall sift him.
1051: King. We will try it.
1052: King. What dost thou mean by this?
1053: King. What do you call the play?
1054: King. What, gertrude? How does hamlet?
1055: King. What is the cause, laertes,
1056: King. Where are my switzers? Let them guard the door.
1057: King. Where is polonius?
1058: King. Who shall stay you?
1059: King. Why, now you speak
1060: King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
1061: King. Will you know them then?
1062: King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
1063: King. [aside] it is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
1064: King. [aside] o, 'tis too true!
1065: King. [rises] my words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
1066: King. 'tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
1067: King. 'tis hamlet's character. 'naked! '
1068: King. 'tis sweet and commendable in your nature, hamlet,
1069: Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
1070: Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
1071: Laer. And so have i a noble father lost;
1072: Laer. A norman was't?
1073: Laer. A touch, a touch; i do confess't.
1074: Laer. Ay my lord,
1075: Laer. Come, my lord. They play.
1076: Laer. Come, one for me.
1077: Laer. Do you see this, o god?
1078: Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
1079: Laer. Farewell. Exit.
1080: Laer. Farewell, ophelia, and remember well
1081: Laer. For hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
1082: Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
1083: Laer. Have at you now!
1084: Laer. He is justly serv'd.
1085: Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
1086: Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
1087: Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
1088: Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
1089: Laer. I pray you give me leave.
1090: Laer. I thank you. Keep the door. [exeunt his followers. ]
1091: Laer. It well appears. But tell me
1092: Laer. I will do't!
1093: Laer. Know you the hand?
1094: Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
1095: Laer. Let this be so.
1096: Laer. Most humbly do i take my leave, my lord.
1097: Laer. Must there no more be done?
1098: Laer. My dread lord,
1099: Laer. My lord, i'll hit him now.
1100: Laer. My lord, i will be rul'd;
1101: Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
1102: Laer. My will, not all the world!
1103: Laer. No.
1104: Laer. None but his enemies.
1105: Laer. O, fear me not!
1106: Laer. O, treble woe
1107: Laer. Say you so? Come on. Play.
1108: Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
1109: Laer. The devil take thy soul!
1110: Laer. Think it no more.
1111: Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
1112: Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
1113: Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
1114: Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
1115: Laer. To his good friends thus wide i'll ope my arms
1116: Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor ophelia,
1117: Laer. Upon my life, lamound.
1118: Laer. Well, again!
1119: Laer. What ceremony else?
1120: Laer. What part is that, my lord?
1121: Laer. Where is my father?
1122: Laer. Where is this king? - sirs, staid you all without.
1123: Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, osric.
1124: Laer. You mock me, sir.
1125: Laer. [aside] and yet it is almost against my conscience.
1126: Laertes, son to polonius.
1127: Leaps in the grave.
1128: Leave us.
1129: Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! Sit you down
1130: Let hercules himself do what he may,
1131: Let him go, gertrude. Do not fear our person.
1132: Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
1133: Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
1134: Let not the royal bed of denmark be
1135: Let's do't, i pray; and i this morning know
1136: Look to't, i charge you. Come your ways.
1137: Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
1138: Lord. My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young osric, who
1139: Lord. The king and queen and all are coming down.
1140: Lord. The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
1141: Lords, ladies, officers, soldiers, sailors, messengers, attendants.
1142: Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
1143: Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
1144: Mad call i it; for, to define true madness,
1145: Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
1146: Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Exeunt.
1147: Mar. And liegemen to the dane.
1148: Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
1149: Mar. Holla, bernardo!
1150: Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
1151: Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
1152: Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
1153: Mar. Is it not like the king?
1154: Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
1155: Mar. It is offended.
1156: Mar. Let's follow. 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
1157: Mar. Look with what courteous action
1158: Mar. Lord hamlet!
1159: Mar. My good lord!
1160: Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
1161: Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
1162: Mar. No, it is struck.
1163: Mar. Nor i, my lord.
1164: Mar. Nor i, my lord- in faith.
1165: Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
1166: Mar. O, wonderful!
1167: Mar. Peace! Break thee off! Look where it comes again!
1168: Mar. Question it, horatio.
1169: Mar. Shall i strike at it with my partisan?
1170: Mar. Something is rotten in the state of denmark.
1171: Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, horatio.
1172: Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
1173: Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
1174: Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
1175: Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
1176: Marcellus?
1177: Marcellus, officer.
1178: Marcellus, officer.
1179: Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
1180: Mar. 'tis gone!
1181: Mar. 'tis gone and will not answer.
1182: May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
1183: Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
1184: Mess. Letters, my lord, from hamlet:
1185: Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; i saw them not.
1186: Mess. Save yourself, my lord:
1187: Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
1188: Moreover that we much did long to see you,
1189: Most holy and religious fear it is
1190: Most necessary 'tis that we forget
1191: Most welcome home! Exeunt ambassadors.
1192: Must i remember? Why, she would hang on him
1193: My brother shall know of it; and so i thank you for your good
1194: My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
1195: My father- methinks i see my father.
1196: My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
1197: My liege, and madam, to expostulate
1198: My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
1199: My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
1200: My soul is full of discord and dismay.
1201: My spirits grow dull, and fain i would beguile
1202: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
1203: My tables! Meet it is i set it down
1204: My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
1205: My uncle?
1206: Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
1207: Nay, come, let's go together.
1208: Near elsinore.
1209: Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
1210: Never to speak of this that you have heard:
1211: No.
1212: No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
1213: No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
1214: No more, sweet hamlet!
1215: None wed the second but who killed the first.
1216: No, no, he is dead;
1217: Now follows, that you know, young fortinbras,
1218: Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
1219: Now, out of this-
1220: Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
1221: Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
1222: O good horatio, what a wounded name
1223: O hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
1224: O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
1225: O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
1226: O heavens! Is't possible a young maid's wits
1227: O heavy burthen!
1228: O, ho!
1229: O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
1230: O most pernicious woman!
1231: O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
1232: One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
1233: One word more, good lady.
1234: On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
1235: Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
1236: Oph. At home, my lord.
1237: Oph. Ay, my lord.
1238: Oph. Ay, my lord.
1239: Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
1240: Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
1241: Oph. Do you doubt that?
1242: Oph. Good my lord,
1243: Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
1244: Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
1245: Oph. I do not know, my lord, what i should think,
1246: Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but i cannot
1247: Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, i'll make an end on't!
1248: Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
1249: Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
1250: Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
1251: Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
1252: Oph. I was the more deceived.
1253: Oph. Madam, i wish it may.
1254: Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
1255: Oph. My lord?
1256: Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
1257: Oph. My lord, i do not know,
1258: Oph. My lord, i have remembrances of yours
1259: Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
1260: Oph. No more but so?
1261: Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
1262: Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
1263: Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
1264: Oph. O my lord, my lord, i have been so affrighted!
1265: Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
1266: Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
1267: Oph. Say you? Nay, pray you mark.
1268: Oph. So please you, something touching the lord hamlet.
1269: Oph. Still better, and worse.
1270: Oph. The king rises.
1271: Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
1272: Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
1273: Oph. Well, god dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
1274: Oph. What is, my lord?
1275: Oph. What means this, my lord?
1276: Oph. What means your lordship?
1277: Oph. Where is the beauteous majesty of denmark?
1278: Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
1279: Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
1280: Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
1281: Oph. You are merry, my lord.
1282: Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
1283: Oph. You must sing 'a-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a. ' o,
1284: Ophelia, daughter to polonius.
1285: Oph. (sings)
1286: Oph. (sings)
1287: Oph. (sings)
1288: Oph. (sings)
1289: Oph. 'tis brief, my lord.
1290: Oph. 'tis in my memory lock'd,
1291: Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
1292: Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
1293: Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
1294: Or that the everlasting had not fix'd
1295: O, say!
1296: O shame! Where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
1297: Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
1298: Osr. Ay, my good lord.
1299: Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- i cannot
1300: Osr. How is't, laertes?
1301: Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
1302: Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
1303: Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
1304: Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
1305: Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
1306: Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
1307: Osr. Look to the queen there, ho!
1308: Osr. Nothing neither way.
1309: Osr. Rapier and dagger.
1310: Osr. Shall i redeliver you e'en so?
1311: Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, i should impart
1312: Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
1313: Osr. The king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
1314: Osr. The king, sir, hath wager'd with him six barbary horses;
1315: Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is-
1316: Osr. Young fortinbras, with conquest come from poland,
1317: Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to denmark.
1318: Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
1319: Osric, courtier.
1320: O, step between her and her fighting soul
1321: O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
1322: Other. But is this law?
1323: Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
1324: Other. Marry, now i can tell!
1325: Other. Mass, i cannot tell.
1326: Other. Nay, but hear you, goodman delver!
1327: Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
1328: Other. Was he a gentleman?
1329: Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
1330: Other. Why, he had none.
1331: Other. Why, 'tis found so.
1332: Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
1333: O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
1334: O, this is counter, you false danish dogs!
1335: Out, out, thou strumpet fortune! All you gods,
1336: O, vengeance!
1337: O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
1338: O what a rogue and peasant slave am i!
1339: O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
1340: O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
1341: Perchance 'twill walk again.
1342: Perpend.
1343: Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
1344: Player. I warrant your honour.
1345: Players.
1346: Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
1347: Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
1348: Pol. And let him ply his music.
1349: Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- what was i about to say?
1350: Pol. And the queen too, and that presently.
1351: Pol. At such a time i'll loose my daughter to him.
1352: Pol. Away, i do beseech you, both away
1353: Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
1354: Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
1355: Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
1356: Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
1357: Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the king.
1358: Pol. Come, sirs.
1359: Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
1360: Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
1361: Pol. Farewell!
1362: Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
1363: Pol. Fore god, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
1364: Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
1365: Pol. Give him this money and these notes, reynaldo.
1366: Pol. Give o'er the play.
1367: Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
1368: Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful. [reads. ]
1369: Pol. Hath there been such a time- i would fain know that-
1370: Pol. Have i, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
1371: Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
1372: Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
1373: Pol. Honest, my lord?
1374: Pol. I did enact julius caesar; i was kill'd i' th' capitol; brutus
1375: Pol. If you call me jephthah, my lord, i have a daughter that i
1376: Pol. I have, my lord.
1377: Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
1378: Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
1379: Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [aside] how pregnant sometimes
1380: Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
1381: Pol. It shall do well. But yet do i believe
1382: Pol. I will say so. Exit.
1383: Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
1384: Pol. Madam, i swear i use no art at all.
1385: Pol. Mad for thy love?
1386: Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
1387: Pol. Marry, well bethought!
1388: Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
1389: Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
1390: Pol. My lord, i have news to tell you.
1391: Pol. My lord, i will use them according to their desert.
1392: Pol. My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
1393: Pol. Not i, my lord.
1394: Pol. Th' ambassadors from norway, my good lord,
1395: Pol. That did i, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
1396: Pol. That hath made him mad.
1397: Pol. That's good! 'mobled queen' is good.
1398: Pol. That's very true, my lord.
1399: Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
1400: Pol. This business is well ended.
1401: Pol. This is too long.
1402: Pol. Upon my honour-
1403: Pol. Very like a whale.
1404: Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
1405: Pol. What do you think of me?
1406: Pol. What follows then, my lord?
1407: Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
1408: Pol. What is't, ophelia, he hath said to you?
1409: Pol. What said he?
1410: Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
1411: Pol. With what, i' th' name of god i
1412: Pol. Yet here, laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
1413: Pol. You go to seek the lord hamlet. There he is.
1414: Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
1415: Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good reynaldo,
1416: Pol. 'and in part him, but, ' you may say, 'not well.
1417: Pol. [aside] how say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
1418: Pol. [aside] though this be madness, yet there is a method in't. -
1419: Pol. [behind] o, i am slain!
1420: Pol. [behind] what, ho! Help, help, help!
1421: Polonius, lord chamberlain.
1422: Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] take this from this, if this
1423: Pol. 'tis most true;
1424: Pol. [to the king] o, ho! Do you mark that?
1425: Pours the poison in his ears.
1426: Pray you be round with him.
1427: Pray you pass with your best violence;
1428: Prepare to play.
1429: Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
1430: Priest. No more be done.
1431: Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
1432: Purpose is but the slave to memory,
1433: Queen. Alack,
1434: Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
1435: Queen. Alas, he's mad!
1436: Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
1437: Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
1438: Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
1439: Queen. As kill a king?
1440: Queen. Ay, amen!
1441: Queen. Ay me, what act,
1442: Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
1443: Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
1444: Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
1445: Queen. But not by him!
1446: Queen. Calmly, good laertes.
1447: Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
1448: Queen. Come hither, my dear hamlet, sit by me.
1449: Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
1450: Queen. Did he receive you well?
1451: Queen. Did you assay him
1452: Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
1453: Queen. For love of god, forbear him!
1454: Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
1455: Queen. Good hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
1456: Queen. Hamlet, hamlet!
1457: Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
1458: Queen. Have you forgot me?
1459: Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
1460: Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
1461: Queen. How fares my lord?
1462: Queen. How now, ophelia?
1463: Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
1464: Queen. If it be,
1465: Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; i hear him coming.
1466: Queen. I shall obey you;
1467: Queen. It may be, very like.
1468: Queen. I will, my lord; i pray you pardon me. Drinks.
1469: Queen. I will not speak with her.
1470: Queen. Let her come in.
1471: Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, hamlet.
1472: Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
1473: Queen. More matter, with less art.
1474: Queen. Nay, but ophelia-
1475: Queen. Nay, then i'll set those to you that can speak.
1476: Queen. No more!
1477: Queen. No, no! The drink, the drink! O my dear hamlet!
1478: Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
1479: Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
1480: Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is i see.
1481: Queen. O hamlet, speak no more!
1482: Queen. O hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
1483: Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
1484: Queen. O my son, what theme?
1485: Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
1486: Queen. O, speak to me no more!
1487: Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
1488: Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
1489: Queen. So he does indeed.
1490: Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
1491: Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
1492: Queen. Thanks, guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz.
1493: Queen. The instances that second marriage move
1494: Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
1495: Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
1496: Queen. This is mere madness;
1497: Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
1498: Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
1499: Queen. To whom do you speak this?
1500: Queen. What have i done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
1501: Queen. What shall i do?
1502: Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
1503: Queen. What would she have?
1504: Queen. Why, how now, hamlet?
1505: Quoth she, 'before you tumbled me,
1506: Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
1507: Rey. As gaming, my lord.
1508: Rey. At 'closes in the consequence, ' at 'friend or so, ' and
1509: Rey. Ay, my lord,
1510: Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
1511: Rey. But, my good lord-
1512: Rey. Good my lord! [going. ]
1513: Rey. I shall, my lord.
1514: Rey. I will, my lord.
1515: Rey. My lord, i did intend it.
1516: Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
1517: Rey. Well, my lord.
1518: Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
1519: Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
1520: Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- hercules and his load too.
1521: Ros. Believe what?
1522: Ros. Both your majesties
1523: Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
1524: Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
1525: Ros. Good my lord!
1526: Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
1527: Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
1528: Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
1529: Ros. Ho, guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
1530: Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself
1531: Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
1532: Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
1533: Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
1534: Ros. Most like a gentleman.
1535: Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
1536: Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
1537: Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
1538: Ros. My most dear lord!
1539: Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
1540: Ros. Neither, my lord.
1541: Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
1542: Ros. No indeed are they not.
1543: Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
1544: Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
1545: Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
1546: Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
1547: Ros. Then is the world one.
1548: Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
1549: Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
1550: Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
1551: Ros. To what end, my lord?
1552: Ros. Truly, and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
1553: Ros. We shall, my lord.
1554: Ros. We think not so, my lord.
1555: Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
1556: Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
1557: Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'tis too narrow for your
1558: Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
1559: Ros. [aside to guildenstern] what say you?
1560: Rosencrantz, courtier.
1561: Ros. [to polonius] god save you, sir!
1562: Sailor. God bless you, sir.
1563: Sailor. 'a shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
1564: Say, voltemand, what from our brother norway?
1565: Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?

1583: Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
1584: Set your entreatments at a higher rate
1585: Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
1586: Sir, in this audience,

1588: So, by my former lecture and advice,
1589: So excellent a king, that was to this
1590: So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
1591: So full of artless jealousy is guilt
1592: Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes

1594: So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
1595: So think thou wilt no second husband wed;

1598: Speak of it! Stay, and speak! - stop it, marcellus!
1599: Speak to her, hamlet.
1600: Spreads his arms.
1601: Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
1602: Such was the very armour he had on
1603: Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
1604: Swear by my sword.
1605: Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
1606: Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
1607: Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
1608: Tell him that by his license fortinbras
1609: That cannot be; since i am still possess'd
1610: That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
1611: That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
1612: That i am guiltless of your father's death,
1613: That i distrust you. Yet, though i distrust,
1614: That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
1615: That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
1616: The bark is ready and the wind at help,
1617: The canker galls the infants of the spring
1618: The chariest maid is prodigal enough
1619: The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,

1628: The head is not more native to the heart,
1629: The king is a thing-
1630: Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
1631: Then, venom, to thy work. Hurts the king.
1632: Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
1633: The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
1634: The queen carouses to thy fortune, hamlet.

1636: There are more things in heaven and earth, horatio,
1637: Therefore i have entreated him along,
1638: Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
1639: Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,

1667: This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
1668: This must not be. ' and then i prescripts gave her,
1669: This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. Exit.

1700: Well may it sort that this portentous figure
1701: We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
1702: We'll put the matter to the present push. -
1703: We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
1704: Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
1705: We should profane the service of the dead
1706: What does this mean, my lord?
1707: What, have you given him any hard words of late?
1708: What is between you? Give me up the truth.
1709: What is the matter?
1710: What is the reason that you use me thus?
1711: What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
1712: What might you think? No, i went round to work
1713: What's hecuba to him, or he to hecuba,
1714: What think you on't?
1715: What to ourselves in passion we propose,
1716: What wouldst thou have, laertes?
1717: When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
1718: When in your motion you are hot and dry-

1720: Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
1721: Where is your son?
1722: Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
1723: Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;

1726: Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
1727: Who calls me villain? Breaks my pate across?
1728: Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
1729: Who hath reliev'd you?
1730: Who is't that can inform me?
1731: Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
1732: Why, what an ass am i! This is most brave,
1733: Will return'd shall know you are come home.
1734: Witness this army of such mass and charge,
1735: Woo't drink up esill? Eat a crocodile?
1736: Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't fast? Woo't tear thyself?

1793: ah, mine own lord, what have i seen to-night!
1794: air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
1795: a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
1796: a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
1797: alack, and fie for shame!
1798: alexander was buried, alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
1799: a little ere the mightiest julius fell,
1800: a little month, or ere those shoes were old
1801: all flaxen was his poll.
1802: all from her father's death. O gertrude, gertrude,
1803: all given to mine ear.
1804: all in the morning bedtime,
1805: all my smooth body.
1806: all saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
1807: all welcome. We'll e'en to't like french falconers, fly at

1815: among a mineral of metals base,
1816: an anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
1817: ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They

1819: and all we mourn for.
1820: and a man's life is no more than to say 'one. '
1821: and am most sensibly in grief for it,
1822: and a most instant tetter bark'd about,
1823: and, as he drains his draughts of rhenish down,
1824: and, as i think, they have already order
1825: and as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
1826: and, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
1827: and, as the world were now but to begin,
1828: and, as you said, and wisely was it said,
1829: and at our more consider'd time we'll read,
1830: and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
1831: and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
1832: and batten on this moor? Ha! Have you eyes
1833: and bear it to the chapel.
1834: and bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
1835: and blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
1836: and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
1837: and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
1838: and both neglect. What if this cursed hand
1839: and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
1840: and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
1841: and break your own neck down.
1842: and breath of life, i have no life to breathe
1843: and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is.
1844: and, but that great command o'ersways the order,
1845: and by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
1846: and call it accident.
1847: and call the noblest to the audience.
1848: and can say nothing! No, not for a king,
1849: and carriage of the article design'd,
1850: and cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
1851: and convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
1852: and could of men distinguish, her election
1853: and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
1854: and curd, like eager droppings into milk,
1855: and do not spread the compost on the weeds
1856: and do such bitter business as the day
1857: and do't the speedier that you may direct me
1858: and draw you into madness? Think of it.
1859: and drive his purpose on to these delights.
1860: and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
1861: and dupp'd the chamber door,
1862: and each particular hair to stand an end
1863: and either [master] the devil, or throw him out
1864: and end his being. That done, he lets me go,
1865: and, england, if my love thou hold'st at aught, -
1866: and enterprises of great pith and moment
1867: and ever three parts coward, - i do not know
1868: and fall a-cursing like a very drab,
1869: and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
1870: and foreign mart for implements of war;
1871: and for his death no wind
1872: and for my soul, what can it do to that,
1873: and for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
1874: and for your part, ophelia, i do wish
1875: and for your rapier most especially,
1876: and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
1877: and from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
1878: and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
1879: and gather by him, as he is behav'd,
1880: and gave you such a masterly report
1881: and gem of all the nation.
1882: and gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
1883: and hath abatements and delays as many
1884: and hath shipped me intil the land,
1885: and hears it roar beneath.
1886: and he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
1887: and he not from his reason fall'n thereon
1888: and here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
1889: and he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
1890: and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' sundays.
1891: and he to england shall along with you.
1892: and his commission to employ those soldiers,
1893: and his sandal shoon.
1894: and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
1895: and hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
1896: and hit the woundless air. - o, come away!
1897: and how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
1898: and how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
1899: and hurt my brother.
1900: and i a maid at your window,
1901: and i am sick at heart.
1902: and i believe it is a fetch of warrant.
1903: and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose
1904: and i do think- or else this brain of mine
1905: and i'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
1906: and in a postscript here, he says 'alone. '
1907: and in his grave rain'd many a tear.
1908: and in part him. ' do you mark this, reynaldo?
1909: and in the cup an union shall he throw
1910: and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
1911: and in the porches of my ears did pour
1912: and in this brainish apprehension kills
1913: and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
1914: and, in this upshot, purposes mistook
1915: and i the matter will reword; which madness
1916: and it must follow, as the night the day,
1917: and i with them the third night kept the watch;
1918: and keep you in the rear of your affection,
1919: and lay your hands again upon my sword.
1920: and leads the will to desperate undertakings
1921: and let all sleep, while to my shame i see
1922: and let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
1923: and let him know so.
1924: and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
1925: and let me wring your heart; for so i shall
1926: and let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
1927: and let them know both what we mean to do
1928: and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark.
1929: and let us hear bernardo speak of this.
1930: and let us once again assail your ears,
1931: and, like a man to double business bound,
1932: and, like a neutral to his will and matter,
1933: and, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
1934: and live the purer with the other half,
1935: and lose the name of action. - soft you now!
1936: and lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, laertes,
1937: and makes as healthful music. It is not madness
1938: and makes each petty artire in this body
1939: and makes us rather bear those ills we have
1940: and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes
1941: and many such-like as's of great charge,
1942: and marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
1943: and meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
1944: and melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
1945: and, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
1946: and more above, hath his solicitings,
1947: and much offence too. Touching this vision here,
1948: and my imaginations are as foul
1949: and my young mistress thus i did bespeak:
1950: and never did the cyclops' hammers fall
1951: and not have strew'd thy grave.
1952: and nothing is at a like goodness still;
1953: and not where i had aim'd them.
1954: and now i'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
1955: and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
1956: and oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
1957: and our affairs from england come too late.
1958: and our vain blows malicious mockery.
1959: and passion in the gods. '
1960: and pious action we do sugar o'er
1961: and pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
1962: and prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
1963: and prey on garbage.
1964: and prologue to the omen coming on,
1965: and put it in his pocket!
1966: and reason panders will.
1967: and recks not his own rede.
1968: and scape detecting, i will pay the theft.
1969: and set a double varnish on the fame
1970: and sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
1971: and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
1972: and since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
1973: and so am i reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
1974: and spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
1975: and stand a comma 'tween their amities,
1976: and still your fingers on your lips, i pray.
1977: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
1978: and sure i am two men there are not living
1979: and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
1980: and tell you what i know.
1981: and terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
1982: and that he calls for drink, i'll have prepar'd him
1983: and that his soul may be as damn'd and black
1984: and that, i hope, will teach you to imagine-
1985: and that in hamlet's hearing, for a quality
1986: and that in way of caution- i must tell you
1987: and that i see, in passages of proof,
1988: and that our drift look through our bad performance.
1989: and that shall lend a kind of easiness
1990: and that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
1991: and the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
1992: and then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
1993: and then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
1994: and then, you know,
1995: and there assume some other, horrible form
1996: and there did seem in him a kind of joy
1997: and therefore i forbid my tears; but yet
1998: and therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
1999: and there i see such black and grained spots
2000: and they can well on horseback; but this gallant
2001: and they in france of the best rank and station
2002: and they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
2003: and think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
2004: and thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
2005: and thou must cure me. Till i know 'tis done,
2006: and thrice his head thus waving up and down,
2007: and thus a while the fit will work on him.
2008: and thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
2009: and thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
2010: and thus the native hue of resolution
2011: and thy best graces spend it at thy will!
2012: and thy commandment all alone shall live
2013: and to such wondrous doing brought his horse
2014: and to the last bended their light on me.
2015: and to the manner born, it is a custom
2016: and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
2017: and vanish'd from our sight.
2018: and wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
2019: and waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
2020: and wants not buzzers to infect his ear
2021: and we beseech you, bend you to remain
2022: and we cast away moan.
2023: and we did think it writ down in our duty
2024: and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
2025: and we shall jointly labour with your soul
2026: and whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
2027: and what so poor a man as hamlet is
2028: and what's untimely done. [so haply slander-]
2029: and when he's not himself does wrong laertes,
2030: and when you are desirous to be blest,
2031: and where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
2032: and where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
2033: and who in want a hollow friend doth try,
2034: and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
2035: and will he not come again?
2036: and will not let belief take hold of him
2037: and will not wrong it.
2038: and will this brother's wager frankly play.
2039: and with a larger tether may he walk
2040: and with a look so piteous in purport
2041: and with a sudden vigour it doth posset
2042: and with his head over his shoulder turn'd
2043: and, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
2044: and with no less nobility of love
2045: and with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
2046: and with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
2047: and with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
2048: and (would it were not so! ) you are my mother.
2049: and you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
2050: and you must needs have heard, how i am punish'd
2051: and you must put me in your heart for friend,
2052: and you yourself shall keep the key of it.
2053: an eye like mars, to threaten and command;
2054: a noise within.
2055: answer, and think upon this business.
2056: answer is i can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
2057: an thou hadst not come to my bed. '

2073: are unwrung.
2074: argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.

2090: as did that one; and that, in my regard,
2091: as e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
2092: as england was his faithful tributary,
2093: a serpent stung me. So the whole ear of denmark
2094: as false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
2095: as fits a king's remembrance.

2103: as he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
2104: (as how should it be so? How otherwise? ),
2105: as hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
2106: [aside] to my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
2107: as i do thee. Something too much of this i

2109: as if i had never been such.
2110: as if increase of appetite had grown
2111: as if it some impartment did desire

2235: but in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
2236: but, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
2237: but it reserv'd some quantity of choice
2238: but i will delve one yard below their mines
2239: but keep a farm and carters.
2240: but let it be. Horatio, i am dead;
2241: but let me hear from you.
2242: but, like the owner of a foul disease,
2243: but mad in craft. 'twere good you let him know;
2244: but mere implorators of unholy suits,
2245: but never doubt i love.
2246: but never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
2247: but not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
2248: but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
2249: but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
2250: but pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
2251: but since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
2252: but, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
2253: but that i know love is begun by time,
2254: but that the dread of something after death-
2255: but that this folly douts it. Exit.
2256: but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,

2258: but to confront the visage of offence?
2259: but to my mind, though i am native here
2260: but to recover of us, by strong hand
2261: but truly i do fear it.
2262: but we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
2263: but what, in faith, make you from wittenberg?
2264: but what we do determine oft we break.
2265: but with a crafty madness keeps aloof
2266: but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
2267: but yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
2268: but you must know, your father lost a father;
2269: buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
2270: by cock, they are to blame.
2271: by desperate appliance are reliev'd,
2272: by indirections find directions out.
2273: by laboursome petition, and at last
2274: by letters congruing to that effect,
2275: by their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
2276: by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
2277: by the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
2278: by this encompassment and drift of question
2279: by what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
2280: by william shakespeare
2281: calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
2282: calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
2283: can serve my turn? 'forgive me my foul murther'?
2284: can you advise me?
2285: caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
2286: carpenter?
2287: carried away. The poisoner wooes the queen with gifts; she

2289: carrying, i say, the stamp of one defect,
2290: carrying torches.

2295: christians, nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man, have so
2296: chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
2297: church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!

2299: clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
2300: claudius, king of denmark.

2306: come, i will give you way for these your letters,
2307: comes armed through our watch, so like the king
2308: come short of what he did.

2316: contagious blastments are most imminent.
2317: continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
2318: convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,

2324: craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
2325: cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
2326: crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
2327: cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
2328: cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
2329: dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
2330: dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant hamlet
2331: dare scarce come thither.
2332: defence?
2333: deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
2334: demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son
2335: denmark? - what, my young lady and mistress? By'r lady, your
2336: depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
2337: desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own
2338: deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison
2339: devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
2340: devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
2341: did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
2342: did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
2343: did hamlet so envenom with his envy
2344: did nothing.
2345: did not together pluck such envy from him
2346: did slay this fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
2347: did sometimes march? By heaven i charge thee speak!
2348: did squeak and gibber in the roman streets;
2349: did the first murther! This might be the pate of a politician,
2350: did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
2351: died. They say he made a good end.
2352: dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
2353: dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
2354: directly seasons him his enemy.
2355: disasters in the sun; and the moist star
2356: discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
2357: discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
2358: discourse to your beauty.
2359: discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
2360: discretion.
2361: divided from herself and her fair-judgment,

2363: does by their own insinuation grow.
2364: does not divide the sunday from the week.
2365: do i impart toward you. For your intent
2366: do not as some ungracious pastors do,
2367: do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
2368: do not itself unkennel in one speech,
2369: doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
2370: doth all the noble substance often dout to his own scandal.
2371: doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
2372: doth rend the region; so, after pyrrhus' pause,
2373: doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
2374: doubt that the sun doth move;
2375: 'doubt thou the stars are fire;
2376: doubt truth to be a liar;
2377: drabbing. You may go so far.
2378: dramatis personae
2379: dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
2380: drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
2381: [drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
2382: dungeons, denmark being one o' th' worst.
2383: each opposite that blanks the face of joy
2384: each small annexment, petty consequence,
2385: each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.
2386: ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
2387: earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he
2388: eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
2389: else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
2390: elsinore.

2403: entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
2404: entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
2405: epitaph is 'for o, for o, the hobby-horse is forgot! '
2406: equivocation will undo us. By the lord, horatio, this three years
2407: ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
2408: ere you had done.
2409: escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
2410: especially where he speaks of priam's slaughter. If it live in
2411: even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
2412: even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
2413: even in their promise, as it is a-making,
2414: even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
2415: even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
2416: even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
2417: even with the very comment of thy soul
2418: excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
2419: excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
2420: excitements of my reason and my blood,

2431: [exit polonius. ]
2432: [exit queen. ]
2433: [exit second clown. ]
2434: [exit the queen. Then] exit hamlet, tugging in
2435: exposing what is mortal and unsure
2436: extorted treasure in the womb of earth
2437: eyes. Prithee no more!
2438: faculties! In form and moving how express and admirable! In
2439: fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can i
2440: fall ten times treble on that cursed head
2441: farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
2442: father?
2443: favours?
2444: favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, horatio,
2445: fay, i cannot reason.
2446: feather. I have of late- but wherefore i know not- lost all my
2447: feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
2448: fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
2449: fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
2450: find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
2451: fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of
2452: finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
2453: fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
2454: first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have
2455: fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
2456: folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
2457: for and a shrouding sheet;
2458: for art and exercise in your defence,
2459: for bearers of this greeting to old norway,
2460: for by the image of my cause i see
2461: fordo it own life. 'twas of some estate.
2462: for england.
2463: for england. Of them i have much to tell thee. Farewell.
2464: for every man hath business and desire,
2465: for food and diet, to some enterprise
2466: for goodness, growing to a plurisy,
2467: for good polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
2468: for he himself is subject to his birth.
2469: for her perfections. But my revenge will come.
2470: for he was likely, had he been put on,
2471: for husband shalt thou-
2472: for i mine eyes will rivet to his face,
2473: for in the fatness of these pursy times
2474: for it is as the air, invulnerable,
2475: for like the hectic in my blood he rages,
2476: for loan oft loses both itself and friend,
2477: for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again. - what do you
2478: form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
2479: form of the thing, each word made true and good,
2480: for murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
2481: for out o' doors he went without their help
2482: for some must watch, while some must sleep:
2483: (for so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
2484: for such a guest is meet.
2485: for such a guest is meet.
2486: for that which thou hast done, - must send thee hence
2487: for the apparel oft proclaims the man,
2488: for the demand of our neglected tribute.
2489: (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
2490: for the supply and profit of our hope,
2491: for they are actions that a man might play;
2492: for this effect defective comes by cause.
2493: for, though i am not splenitive and rash,
2494: for 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
2495: for 'tis the sport to have the enginer
2496: fortunes turn turk with me-with two provincial roses on my raz'd
2497: for use almost can change the stamp of nature,
2498: forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
2499: for we have closely sent for hamlet hither,
2500: for we will fetters put upon this fear,
2501: for what advancement may i hope from thee,
2502: for what we know must be, and is as common
2503: (for which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
2504: for who not needs shall never lack a friend,
2505: for who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
2506: for women's fear and love holds quantity,
2507: for your succession in denmark?
2508: freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
2509: free me so far in your most generous thoughts
2510: from another one?
2511: from fashion of himself. What think you on't?
2512: from me, whose love was of that dignity
2513: from our achievements, though perform'd at height,
2514: from that particular fault. The dram of e'il
2515: from the fair forehead of an innocent love,
2516: from the first corse till he that died to-day,
2517: from whence though willingly i came to denmark
2518: full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
2519: further trade with us?
2520: 'gainst fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
2521: gentleman. '
2522: gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' christian burial.
2523: gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as i may say)
2524: get from him why he puts on this confusion,
2525: [ghost beckons. ]
2526: give it an understanding but no tongue.
2527: give me my father!
2528: give me one poor request.
2529: give, me superfluous death. A noise within.
2530: give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, i'll ha't.
2531: given private time to you, and you yourself
2532: given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you

2534: gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
2535: giving more light than heat, extinct in both
2536: giving to you no further personal power
2537: glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry
2538: god willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
2539: goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
2540: gone, far gone! And truly in my youth i suff'red much extremity
2541: gonzago'?
2542: good gertrude, set some watch over your son. -
2543: good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
2544: good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
2545: 'good sir, ' or so, or 'friend, ' or 'gentleman'-
2546: go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
2547: go to thy deathbed;
2548: [grapples with him].
2549: grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
2550: grating so harshly all his days of quiet
2551: grave. ]
2552: grave-making?
2553: great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
2554: great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
2555: grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
2556: grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
2557: grop'd i to find out them; had my desire,
2558: grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
2559: guil. A thing, my lord?
2560: guildenstern, and other lords attendant, with the guard
2561: guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
2562: had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
2563: had he the motive and the cue for passion
2564: had i but time (as this fell sergeant, death,
2565: had it th' ability of life to thank you.
2566: had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
2567: had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
2568: had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
2569: half a year. But, by'r lady, he must build churches then; or else
2570: ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
2571: ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
2572: ham. He will stay till you come.
2573: ham. I beseech you remember.
2574: ham. I dare not confess that, lest i should compare with him in
2575: ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
2576: ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
2577: ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
2578: ham. O god!
2579: ham. O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock'd.
2580: ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
2581: ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
2582: ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
2583: ham. Why, i will fight with him upon this theme
2584: ham. [aside] a little more than kin, and less than kind!
2585: hamlet. '
2586: 'hamlet. '
2587: hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;

2590: ham. 'the mobled queen'?
2591: hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
2592: hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred
2593: hath clawed me in his clutch,
2594: hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
2595: hath in the skirts of norway, here and there,
2596: hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
2597: hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
2598: hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been
2599: hath sent me to you.
2600: hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here i lie,
2601: hautboys play. The dumb show enters.
2602: have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
2603: have by the very cunning of the scene
2604: have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
2605: have heaven and earth together demonstrated

2607: have not the skill.
2608: have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
2609: have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
2610: have sent for you.

2614: having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
2615: hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
2616: he.
2617: he answers:
2618: hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
2619: heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
2620: he closes with you in this consequence:
2621: hecuba.
2622: he falls to such perusal of my face
2623: he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter-
2624: he hath not fail'd to pester us with message
2625: he is dead and gone;
2626: he knew me not at first. He said i was a fishmonger. He is far
2627: he likewise gives a frock or livery,
2628: help to hasten them?
2629: he may approve our eyes and speak to it.
2630: he never will come again.
2631: he rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
2632: her brother is in secret come from france;
2633: here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,

2635: here stooping to your clemency,
2636: here's to thy health.
2637: here was a gentleman of normandy.
2638: her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
2639: heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? For, by my
2640: he seem'd to find his way without his eyes,

2650: him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
2651: him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
2652: him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
2653: him and my daughter. - my honourable lord, i will most humbly take
2654: him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
2655: himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
2656: himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
2657: his access to me.
2658: his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in

2668: his nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
2669: his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth

2671: his silence will sit drooping.
2672: history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
2673: his wife, baptista. You shall see anon. 'tis a knavish piece of

2830: itself to motion, like as it would speak;
2831: it sends some precious instance of itself
2832: it shall as level to your judgment pierce
2833: it shows a will most incorrect to heaven,

2835: it was against your highness; whereat griev'd,
2836: it waves you to a more removed ground.
2837: i will be brief. Your noble son is mad.

2879: lest with this piteous action you convert
2880: let all the battlements their ordnance fire;

2898: like niobe, all tears- why she, even she
2899: like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
2900: like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
2901: like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
2902: like wonder-wounded hearers? This is i,

4006: who in her duty and obedience, mark,
4007: who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
4008: whom i will trust as i will adders fang'd,
4009: whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
4010: whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
4011: whose image even but now appear'd to us,
4012: whose motive in this case should stir me most
4013: whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
4014: whose violent property fordoes itself
4015: whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
4016: whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
4017: whose worth, if praises may go back again,
4018: who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
4019: who was in life a foolish peating knave.
4020: why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
4021: why does the drum come hither?
4022: why seems it so particular with thee?
4023: why should we in our peevish opposition
4024: why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
4025: why the man dies. - i humbly thank you, sir.
4026: why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
4027: why this same strict and most observant watch
4028: why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, gertrude.
4029: why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
4030: why to a public count i might not go
4031: why yet i live to say 'this thing's to do, '
4032: why you proceeded not against these feats

4038: will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between

4040: will nothing stick our person to arraign
4041: will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
4042: will sate itself in a celestial bed
4043: will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
4044: will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
4045: will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
4046: will you be rul'd by me?
4047: will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
4048: will you walk out of the air, my lord?
4049: winner and loser?
4050: with a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,

4057: with an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
4058: with an entreaty, herein further shown,
4059: with arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
4060: with bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
4061: with blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
4062: with eyes like carbuncles, the hellish pyrrhus
4063: with fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
4064: with forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
4065: with hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
4066: with heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
4067: with, hoo! Such bugs and goblins in my life-
4068: within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
4069: within 's two hours.
4070: within the book and volume of my brain,
4071: within the centre.
4072: with juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
4073: with less remorse than pyrrhus' bleeding sword
4074: with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
4075: with mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
4076: with most miraculous organ, i'll have these players
4077: without debatement further, more or less,
4078: without more motive, into every brain
4079: without the sensible and true avouch
4080: without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
4081: with pestilent speeches of his father's death,
4082: with sore distraction. What i have done
4083: with such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
4084: with the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
4085: with this affair along. For all, our thanks.
4086: with this contagion, that, if i gall him slightly,
4087: with this regard their currents turn awry
4088: with this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
4089: with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
4090: with tristful visage, as against the doom,
4091: with true-love showers.
4092: with turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
4093: with us to watch the minutes of this night,
4094: with variable objects, shall expel
4095: with which she followed my poor father's body
4096: with windlasses and with assays of bias,
4097: with witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
4098: with wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
4099: with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which i

4109: would have reverted to my bow again,
4110: would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
4111: would make them capable. - do not look upon me,
4112: would perhaps trouble a woman.
4113: would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
4114: would quake to look on. Soft! Now to my mother!
4115: would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
4116: wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, hamlet, hear.
4117: would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
4118: yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
4119: yea, this solidity and compound mass,
4120: yes, faith, heartily.
4121: yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
4122: yet have i in me something dangerous,
4123: yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
4124: yet now i must confess, that duty done,
4125: yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
4126: yet the unshaped use of it doth move
4127: you are the most immediate to our throne,
4128: you, as your business and desires shall point you,
4129: you cannot call it love; for at your age
4130: you cannot play upon me.
4131: you do not understand yourself so clearly
4132: you from the polack wars, and you from england,
4133: you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
4134: you go not till i set you up a glass
4135: you, good cornelius, and you, voltemand,
4136: you heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
4137: you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
4138: you know the wager?
4139: you mainly were stirr'd up.

4144: you promis'd me to wed. '
4145: your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
4146: your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
4147: your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
4148: your bounty. Take them in.
4149: your friend.
4150: your leave and favour to return to france;
4151: your loneliness. - we are oft to blame in this,
4152: your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:
4153: your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
4154: your name be horatio, as i am let to know it is.
4155: your party in converse, him you would sound,

4159: your table!
4160: your visitation shall receive such thanks

77: Ham. How came he mad?
78: Pol. That hath made him mad.
79: Queen. Alas, he's mad!
80: i will be brief. Your noble son is mad.

92: I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
93: good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
94: or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;

102: Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
103: But wilt thou bear me how i did proceed?
104: as false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
105: but we will ship him hence; and this vile deed

137: since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
138: Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
139: Ham. Pale or red?

141: that, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
142: when he th' ambitious norway combated.
143: wherein our saviour's birth is celebrated,
144: have heaven and earth together demonstrated
145: journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
146: Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
147: Enter ophelia distracted.
148: Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
149: with hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,

151: Oph. O my lord, my lord, i have been so affrighted!
152: which now goes too free-footed.
153: the memory be green, and that it us befitted
154: Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
155: or like a creature native and indued
156: Oph. I was the more deceived.
157: So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
158: by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
159: you promis'd me to wed. '
160: whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
161: she should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
162: whom i will trust as i will adders fang'd,
163: let come what comes; only i'll be reveng'd
164: 'tis heavy with him; and am i then reveng'd,
165: hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
166: Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
167: repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
168: of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
169: Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
170: Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
171: and where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
172: and you must needs have heard, how i am punish'd
173: let in the maid, that out a maid
174: i thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
175: Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
176: set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
177: You need not tell us what lord hamlet said.
178: and, as you said, and wisely was it said,
179: are burnt and purg'd away. But that i am forbid
180: come short of what he did.
181: Hor. My lord, i did;
182: Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
183: in dreadful secrecy impart they did,
184: which happily foreknowing may avoid,
185: now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
186: ham. O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock'd.
187: Oph. 'tis in my memory lock'd,
188: Ham. Why, e'en so! And now my lady worm's, chapless, and knock'd
189: goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
190: so lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
191: Hor. (reads the letter) 'horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
192: Hor. How was this seal'd?
193: unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
194: man is twice a child.
195: But if't be he i mean, he's very wild
196: nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
197: in his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
198: to tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
199: Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
200: within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
201: to mine own room again; making so bold
202: Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'tis bitter cold,
203: Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
204: a little month, or ere those shoes were old
205: to what i shall unfold.
206: Ham. [aside] nay then, i have an eye of you. - if you love me, hold
207: should have a back or second, that might hold
208: Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
209: an understanding simple and unschool'd;
210: And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
211: world.
212: i do not know from what part of the world
213: Laer. My will, not all the world!
214: and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
215: seem to me all the uses of this world!
216: In the corrupted currents of this world
217: Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
218: no hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
219: as 'well, well, we know, ' or 'we could, an if we would, '
220: that treason can but peep to what it would,
221: would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
222: Laer. My lord, i will be rul'd;
223: But let this same be presently perform'd,
224: Hor. You might have rhym'd.
225: and both neglect. What if this cursed hand
226: Laer. Know you the hand?
227: the corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
228: but to recover of us, by strong hand
229: a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
230: If by direct or by collateral hand
231: Thus was i, sleeping, by a brother's hand
232: which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
233: The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
234: Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of denmark, and
235: so nightly toils the subject of the land,
236: and hath shipped me intil the land,
237: of this post-haste and romage in the land.
238: Hor. It must be shortly known to him from england
239: I cannot live to hear the news from england,
240: you from the polack wars, and you from england,
241: thus set it down: he shall with speed to england
242: into england.
243: Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into england?
244: Ham. For england?
245: for england.
246: one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for england!
247: Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for england!
248: the present death of hamlet. Do it, england;
249: have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
250: Capt. Against some part of poland.
251: Osr. Young fortinbras, with conquest come from poland,
252: you, good cornelius, and you, voltemand,
253: th' important acting of your dread command?
254: Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
255: an eye like mars, to threaten and command;
256: put your dread pleasures more into command
257: (o royal knavery! ), an exact command,
258: speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and
259: Rey. At 'closes in the consequence, ' at 'friend or so, ' and
260: Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
261: Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
262: them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
263: crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
264: rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
265: Ham. O good horatio, i'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
266: Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
267: pick'd out of ten thousand.
268: only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and
269: I dare damnation. To this point i stand,
270: conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
271: Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
272: full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
273: end.
274: died. They say he made a good end.
275: The end
276: no more; and by a sleep to say we end
277: for who not needs shall never lack a friend,
278: for loan oft loses both itself and friend,
279: and you must put me in your heart for friend,
280: your friend.
281: and each particular hair to stand an end
282: Perpend.
283: i, his sole son, do this same villain send
284: as make your bouts more violent to that end-
285: and hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
286: Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
287: Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
288: King. Love? His affections do not that way tend;
289: and carriage of the article design'd,
290: that have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
291: If circumstances lead me, i will find
292: And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
293: thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
294: I must be cruel, only to be kind;
295: ham. [aside] a little more than kin, and less than kind!
296: rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
297: honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
298: that thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
299: to hear him so inclin'd.
300: mind.
301: with all the strength and armour of the mind
302: take these again; for to the noble mind
303: lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
304: the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
305: too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
306: and for his death no wind
307: to quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
308: Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
309: and so am i reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
310: that, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
311: never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
312: Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
313: wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
314: was gaged by our king; which had return'd
315: King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
316: are joyfully return'd.
317: and with his head over his shoulder turn'd
318: that father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
319: Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
320: and, like a man to double business bound,
321: as it hath us'd to do- that i have found
322: he tells me, my dear gertrude, he hath found
323: he rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
324: but better look'd into, he truly found
325: Laer. Upon my life, lamound.
326: King. Full thirty times hath phoebus' cart gone round
327: neptune's salt wash and tellus' orbed ground,
328: it waves you to a more removed ground.
329: choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground.
330: we go to gain a little patch of ground
331: millions of acres on us, till our ground,
332: Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
333: Hor. Friends to this ground.
334: Ham. Upon what ground?
335: your party in converse, him you would sound,
336: Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
337: Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
338: his canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O god! God!
339: ham. O god!
340: Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
341: Laer. Do you see this, o god?
342: which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent god,
343: Ham. Good.
344: form of the thing, each word made true and good,
345: that to the use of actions fair and good
346: Pol. Fore god, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
347: no medicine in the world can do thee good.
348: yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
349: It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
350: Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
351: My brother shall know of it; and so i thank you for your good
352: Pol. That's good! 'mobled queen' is good.
353: a savageness in unreclaimed blood,
354: as stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
355: would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
356: hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
357: will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
358: were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
359: contagion to this world. Now could i drink hot blood
360: excitements of my reason and my blood,
361: repast them with my blood.
362: o'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
363: So, as a painted tyrant, pyrrhus stood,
364: Ham. [aside] wormwood, wormwood!
365: who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
366: great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
367: upon a fearful summons. I have heard
368: Fie upon't! Foh! About, my brain! Hum, i have heard
369: Never to speak of this that you have heard:
370: our hasty sending. Something have you heard
371: hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
372: his nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
373: as did that one; and that, in my regard,
374: wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
375: 'tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
376: Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
377: Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
378: hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
379: King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
380: Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
381: guildenstern, and other lords attendant, with the guard
382: Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
383: should be old as i am if, like a crab, you could go backward.
384: a damn'd defeat was made. Am i a coward?
385: Elsinore. A churchyard.
386: that i, the son of a dear father murther'd,
387: Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
388: to feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
389: a sable silver'd.
390: Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
391: enter a lord.
392: Laer. My dread lord,
393: Mar. My good lord!
394: 1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
395: Hor. [aside to hamlet] no, my good lord.
396: Rey. But, my good lord-
397: Osr. Ay, my good lord.
398: Pol. Th' ambassadors from norway, my good lord,
399: Guil. My honour'd lord!
400: Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
401: i'll blessing beg of you. - for this same lord,
402: o'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord;
403: Ros. My most dear lord!
404: Hor. O, my dear lord!
405: Guil. In what, my dear lord?
406: Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'good morrow, sweet lord!
407: [exit lord. ]
408: Oph. My lord?
409: read, my lord?
410: Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
411: Both. Arm'd, my lord.
412: Ros. To what end, my lord?
413: Oph. Good my lord,
414: Ros. Good my lord!
415: Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
416: Hor. Ay, good my lord.
417: Hor. Nay, good my lord -
418: rey. Very good, my lord.
419: Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
420: Hor. (within) my lord, my lord!
421: Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
422: Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
423: Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
424: Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
425: Oph. At home, my lord.
426: Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
427: There, my lord.
428: Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
429: Hor. O, where, my lord?
430: Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
431: Pol. That's very true, my lord.
432: Laer. Most humbly do i take my leave, my lord.
433: Pol. I have, my lord.
434: Oph. 'tis brief, my lord.
435: Mess. Save yourself, my lord:
436: guil. A thing, my lord?
437: Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
438: Rey. As gaming, my lord.
439: Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
440: Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
441: Mar. Nor i, my lord.
442: Pol. Not i, my lord.
443: Rey. I shall, my lord.
444: Ros. We shall, my lord.
445: Hor. Well, my lord.
446: Rey. Well, my lord.
447: Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
448: Ham. Very well, my lord.
449: Hor. Very well, my lord.
450: Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
451: Rey. I will, my lord.
452: What does this mean, my lord?
453: Pol. What follows then, my lord?
454: Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
455: Ros. Ho, guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
456: Guil. Prison, my lord?
457: oph. No, my lord.
458: Both [mar. And ber. ] we do, my lord.
459: Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
460: ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
461: Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
462: hor. E'en so, my lord.
463: Ros. We think not so, my lord.
464: King. Thanks, dear my lord.
465: hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
466: Ros. Neither, my lord.
467: pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
468: Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
469: will you walk out of the air, my lord?
470: Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
471: Queen. How fares my lord?
472: Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
473: laer. What out of this, my lord?
474: Oph. What means this, my lord?
475: Oph. What is, my lord?
476: Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
477: Hor. What news, my lord?
478: Guil. What, my lord?
479: Laer. What part is that, my lord?
480: Hor. What's that, my lord?
481: Hor. It might, my lord.
482: Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
483: Hor. Remember it, my lord!
484: Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
485: Capt. I will do't, my lord.
486: Hor. Do not, my lord!
487: Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
488: Pol. Honest, my lord?
489: the woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
490: Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
491: Oph. Ay, my lord.
492: Oph. Ay, my lord.
493: Laer. Ay my lord,
494: Hor. Ay, my lord.
495: 1. Play. Ay, my lord.
496: 1. Play. Ay, my lord.
497: Rey. Ay, my lord,
498: Guil. What should we say, my lord?
499: Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
500: Oph. You are merry, my lord.
501: than is my deed to my most painted word.
502: Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
503: The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
504: striking too short at greeks. His antique sword,
505: with less remorse than pyrrhus' bleeding sword
506: but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
507: takes prisoner pyrrhus' ear. For lo! His sword,
508: Ghost. [beneath] swear by his sword.
509: Ham. Upon my sword.
510: and lay your hands again upon my sword.
511: And for that purpose i'll anoint my sword.
512: Swear by my sword.
513: swear by my sword.
514: i could a tale unfold whose lightest word
515: so, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
516: Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
517: the ratifiers and props of every word,
518: taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
519: the youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
520: as had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
521: or if it was, not above once; for the play, i remember, pleas'd
522: King. Part them! They are incens'd.
523: too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
524: when that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
525: and with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
526: That cannot be; since i am still possess'd
527: but even then the morning cock crew loud,
528: and gather by him, as he is behav'd,
529: by desperate appliance are reliev'd,
530: it was against your highness; whereat griev'd,
531: and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
532: My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
533: But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
534: Laer. He is justly serv'd.
535: which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
536: not shriving time allow'd.
537: city? Are they so follow'd?
538: Ham. Safely stow'd.
539: Or that the everlasting had not fix'd
540: fortunes turn turk with me-with two provincial roses on my raz'd
541: Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
542: Ber. He.
543: horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
544: dramatis personae
545: be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
546: resembles that it was. What it should be,
547: till then in patience our proceeding be.
548: Let not the royal bed of denmark be
549: where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
550: Ham. That i can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
551: Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
552: a minist'ring angel shall my sister be
553: it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
554: what is't to leave betimes? Let be.
555: Queen. If it be,
556: the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be
557: to fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
558: unto that element; but long it could not be
559: 'swounds, i should take it! For it cannot be
560: But this eternal blazon must not be
561: vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be
562: but fill unshaken when they mellow be.
563: so you will not o'errule me to a peace.
564: This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
565: i have a voice and precedent of peace
566: for i mine eyes will rivet to his face,
567: Ham. Then saw you not his face?
568: Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
569: he falls to such perusal of my face
570: Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
571: Get you a place.
572: as they fell out by time, by means, and place,
573: as he in his particular act and place
574: It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
575: Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
576: A double blessing is a double grace;
577: would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
578: their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
579: he smote the sledded polacks on the ice.
580: but it reserv'd some quantity of choice
581: Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
582: If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
583: on fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
584: Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
585: but even his mother shall uncharge the practice
586: a sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
587: unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
588: offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
589: So, by my former lecture and advice,
590: Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
591: Break we our watch up; and by my advice
592: to exploit now ripe in my device,
593: Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
594: on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
595: O, vengeance!
596: there falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
597: You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
598: even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
599: and that our drift look through our bad performance.
600: Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
601: as fits a king's remembrance.
602: my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france
603: her brother is in secret come from france;
604: your leave and favour to return to france;
605: Ham. I'll be your foil, laertes. In mine ignorance
606: You do remember all the circumstance?
607: One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
608: King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
609: unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
610: more honour'd in the breach than the observance.
611: on such regards of safety and allowance
612: grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
613: It will be laid to us, whose providence
614: defence?
615: for art and exercise in your defence,
616: but to confront the visage of offence?
617: May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
618: that both the world, i give to negligence,
619: for that which thou hast done, - must send thee hence
620: Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
621: and with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
622: How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
623: Laer. [aside] and yet it is almost against my conscience.
624: and call the noblest to the audience.
625: Sir, in this audience,
626: Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
627: We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
628: to offer it the show of violence;
629: nor shall you do my ear that violence
630: Pray you pass with your best violence;
631: be something scanter of your maiden presence.
632: that so his sickness, age, and impotence
633: he closes with you in this consequence:
634: each small annexment, petty consequence,
635: led by a delicate and tender prince,
636: Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
637: importing health and graveness. Two months since
638: Ham. How long is that since?
639: Ham. No, nor mine now. [to polonius] my lord, you play'd once
640: to prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
641: but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
642: Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
643: it shall as level to your judgment pierce
644: And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
645: o, a pit of clay for to be made
646: [sings] o, a pit of clay for to be made
647: the instant burst of clamour that she made
648: till of this flat a mountain you have made
649: wantonness your ignorance. Go to, i'll no more on't! It hath made
650: the lists, and full proportions are all made
651: a pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
652: and recks not his own rede.
653: Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
654: thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
655: Your grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
656: Guil. We will ourselves provide.
657: fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
658: pyrrhus at priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
659: all from her father's death. O gertrude, gertrude,
660: why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, gertrude.
661: King. Let's follow, gertrude.
662: He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
663: gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
664: a ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
665: I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
666: You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. - i am glad to see thee
667: bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
668: and you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
669: why seems it so particular with thee?
670: for what advancement may i hope from thee,
671: Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
672: Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
673: in this distracted globe. Remember thee?
674: but bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
675: Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
676: Go on. I'll follow thee.
677: i say, away! - go on. I'll follow thee.
678: and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
679: you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
680: O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
681: make mad the guilty and appal the free,
682: work; but what o' that? Your majesty, and we that have free
683: which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
684: Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if i could see
685: what part a gentleman would see.
686: if this did blast in proof. Soft! Let me see.
687: your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:
688: An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
689: and let all sleep, while to my shame i see
690: for by the image of my cause i see
691: Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is i see.
692: t' have seen what i have seen, see what i see!
693: Hor. What is it you will see?
694: to keep those many many bodies safe
695: life,
696: In thee there is not half an hour of life.
697: that makes calamity of so long life.
698: guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
699: upon whose property and most dear life
700: thrown out his angle for my proper life,
701: yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
702: Hor. It was, as i have seen it in his life,
703: should be as mortal as an old man's life?
704: the serpent that did sting thy father's life
705: Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
706: pursued my life.
707: with, hoo! Such bugs and goblins in my life-
708: unto young hamlet; for, upon my life,
709: to grunt and sweat under a weary life,
710: both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
711: if, once a widow, ever i be wife!
712: shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of gonzago's wife.
713: You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife,
714: i hop'd thou shouldst have been my hamlet's wife;
715: and prey on garbage.
716: stood challenger on mount of all the age
717: with mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
718: his father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
719: Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
720: When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
721: By heaven, it is as proper to our age
722: you cannot call it love; for at your age
723: nor the dejected havior of the visage,
724: 'tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
725: when he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
726: to have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
727: he hath not fail'd to pester us with message
728: colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
729: bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
730: Ghost cries under the stage.
731: Enter fortinbras with his army over the stage.
732: King. Arm you, i pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
733: the triumph of his pledge.
734: Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
735: Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
736: and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
737: we may of their encounter frankly judge
738: Pol. Have i, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
739: the speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
740: of the unworthiest siege.
741: that even our loves should with our fortunes change;
742: or quit in answer of the third exchange,
743: 'tis strange.
744: hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
745: This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
746: Ham. 'tis very strange.
747: Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
748: bellow for revenge.
749: of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
750: Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
751: may sweep to my revenge.
752: Witness this army of such mass and charge,
753: Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.

759: earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he

780: when i shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the

783: ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the

785: Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
786: hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here i lie,
787: with arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,

796: Queen. It may be, very like.
797: the nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
798: King. The doors are broke.
799: clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
800: the need we have to use you did provoke
801: Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
802: Ham. Or like a whale.
803: Pol. Very like a whale.
804: Ber. How now, horatio? You tremble and look pale.
805: Hor. Nay, very pale.
806: 'i saw him enter such a house of sale, '
807: for it is as the air, invulnerable,
808: King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
809: How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable

812: King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
813: Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! Most horrible!
814: Ham. Is't possible?

824: depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
825: Ber. Sit down awhile,
826: Hor. Season your admiration for a while
827: as to expend your time with us awhile
828: Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
829: absent thee from felicity awhile,
830: Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
831: My spirits grow dull, and fain i would beguile
832: that's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
833: ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
834: in equal scale weighing delight and dole,
835: stopping a bunghole?
836: when yond same star that's westward from the pole

838: upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
839: that from a shelf the precious diadem stole

863: alack, and fie for shame!
864: by cock, they are to blame.
865: I can no more. The king, the king's to blame.
866: O good horatio, what a wounded name
867: that hath in it no profit but the name.
868: that liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
869: transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
870: image of a murther done in vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;
871: our state to be disjoint and out of frame,

880: me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.
881: to speak of horrors- he comes before me.
882: can you advise me?
883: which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
884: you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
885: Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
886: Pol. What do you think of me?
887: i am afeard you make a wanton of me.
888: Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
889: I pray you go with me.
890: to punish me with this, and this with me,

892: Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
893: so hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
894: For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,

909: would make them capable. - do not look upon me,
910: you cannot play upon me.
911: and to the last bended their light on me.
912: If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
913: this, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
914: Come.
915: Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
916: There with fantastic garlands did she come
917: I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
918: to let this canker of our nature come
919: Ham. You are welcome.
920: Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
921: for her perfections. But my revenge will come.
922: not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
923: Be as ourself in denmark. Madam, come.
924: Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
925: church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!
926: that, if again this apparition come,

929: Ghost. My hour is almost come,
930: But come!
931: ham. He will stay till you come.
932: For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
933: Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on hamlet? O, here they come.
934: Will return'd shall know you are come home.
935: her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
936: to hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;

943: speak to me.
944: of his affection to me.
945: stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
946: his access to me.
947: it is 'adieu, adieu! Remember me. '
948: Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
949: king, father, royal dane. O, answer me?
950: Laer. Come, one for me.
951: Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
952: blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
953: Ham. She well instructs me.
954: By heaven, i'll make a ghost of him that lets me! -
955: and do't the speedier that you may direct me
956: Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
957: pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
958: King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
959: Queen. Have you forgot me?
960: Ham. Why did you laugh then, when i said 'man delights not me'?
961: to do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
962: in noise so rude against me?
963: how all occasions do inform against me
964: But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
965: will you be rul'd by me?
966: Queen. Come hither, my dear hamlet, sit by me.
967: Ham. One.
968: I am more an antique roman than a dane.
969: Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned dane,
970: Mar. And liegemen to the dane.
971: You cannot speak of reason to the dane
972: have by the very cunning of the scene
973: tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene
974: receives rebuke from norway, and, in fine,
975: his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
976: Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
977: and that, i hope, will teach you to imagine-
978: King. Take thy fair hour, laertes. Time be thine,
979: King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
980: I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
981: i made to her in marriage, and to decline
982: mine.
983: to those of mine!
984: and i do think- or else this brain of mine
985: I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
986: Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
987: For my part, i do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
988: the thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
989: to be your valentine.
990: like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
991: whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
992: ere you had done.
993: Away! For everything is seal'd and done
994: Priest. No more be done.
995: Laer. Must there no more be done?
996: make us again count o'er ere love be done!
997: If there be any good thing to be done,
998: with sore distraction. What i have done
999: Ros. Then is the world one.
1000: shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
1001: and thou must cure me. Till i know 'tis done,
1002: Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
1003: yet now i must confess, that duty done,
1004: he is dead and gone;
1005: even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
1006: let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
1007: the bell then beating one-
1008: He is gone, he is gone,
1009: Mar. 'tis gone!
1010: your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
1011: now i am alone.
1012: attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
1013: and in a postscript here, he says 'alone. '
1014: to you alone.
1015: For nature crescent does not grow alone
1016: Other. Why, he had none.
1017: i will speak daggers to her, but use none.
1018: from another one?
1019: you are the most immediate to our throne,
1020: at his heels a stone.
1021: would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
1022: and a man's life is no more than to say 'one. '
1023: to you yourself, to us, to every one.
1024: singeing his pate against the burning zone,
1025: on mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
1026: the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
1027: I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
1028: For me, with sorrow i embrace my fortune.
1029: that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
1030: Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
1031: i have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe
1032: Ham. From top to toe?
1033: Laer. O, treble woe
1034: these but the trappings and the suits of woe.
1035: to be contracted in one brow of woe,
1036: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
1037: i'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
1038: thou com'st in such a questionable shape
1039: armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
1040: let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
1041: Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
1042: to business with the king, more than the scope
1043: an anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
1044: to desperation turn my trust and hope,
1045: for the supply and profit of our hope,
1046: could not so mope.
1047: to all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
1048: by william shakespeare
1049: plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
1050: Hor. Half a share.
1051: where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
1052: Hor. [aside] his purse is empty already. All's golden words are
1053: freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
1054: me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
1055: uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring. - masters, you are
1056: of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
1057: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
1058: King. At supper? Where?
1059: but to my mind, though i am native here
1060: much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
1061: drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
1062: and much offence too. Touching this vision here,
1063: that, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
1064: Is it not monstrous that this player here,
1065: Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
1066: Ber. 'tis here!
1067: Hor. 'tis here!
1068: of jove himself; and now reigns here
1069: that youth and observation copied there,
1070: hath in the skirts of norway, here and there,
1071: Ham. Do you see nothing there?
1072: Ham. I would i had been there.
1073: It had been so with us, had we been there.
1074: what, is horatio there ?
1075: or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
1076: O hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
1077: Fran. I think i hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
1078: Ber. Who's there. ?
1079: what is the issue of the business there.
1080: Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'a shall recover his wits there;
1081: where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
1082: Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
1083: to england send him; or confine him where
1084: that he, as 'twere by accident, may here
1085: have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
1086: to their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
1087: let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
1088: 'doubt thou the stars are fire;
1089: Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
1090: and gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
1091: as if it some impartment did desire
1092: for every man hath business and desire,
1093: out of the shot and danger of desire.
1094: it is most retrograde to our desire;
1095: grop'd i to find out them; had my desire,
1096: before you visit him, to make inquire
1097: o'er whom his very madness, like some ore
1098: Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
1099: and thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
1100: never departed more.
1101: would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
1102: to keep itself from noyance; but much more
1103: Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that i will more
1104: and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
1105: Queen. No more!
1106: no more.
1107: 'one fair daughter, and no more,
1108: eyes. Prithee no more!
1109: Queen. O, speak to me no more!
1110: Queen. O hamlet, speak no more!
1111: Laer. Think it no more.
1112: be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
1113: and think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
1114: makes vow before his uncle never more
1115: Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
1116: elsinore.
1117: Scene. - elsinore.
1118: But what is your affair in elsinore?
1119: Near elsinore.
1120: make you at elsinore?
1121: within the centre.
1122: The terms of our estate may not endure
1123: and pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
1124: you heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
1125: Well may it sort that this portentous figure
1126: Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
1127: Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure.
1128: Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
1129: have you so slander any moment leisure
1130: exposing what is mortal and unsure
1131: hunts not the trail of policy so sure
1132: 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
1133: for use almost can change the stamp of nature,
1134: making night hideous, and we fools of nature
1135: till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
1136: yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
1137: Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
1138: so crimeful and so capital in nature,
1139: that grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
1140: a fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
1141: a violet in the youth of primy nature,
1142: Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the scripture?
1143: among a mineral of metals base,
1144: will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
1145: We heard it all. - my lord, do as you please;
1146: but, like the owner of a foul disease,
1147: phrase.
1148: they clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
1149: or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
1150: or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
1151: Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
1152: last, and as such containing as all these,
1153: hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
1154: our purpose may hold there. - but stay, what noise,
1155: Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
1156: for food and diet, to some enterprise
1157: through your dominions for this enterprise,
1158: for who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
1159: when it prov'd otherwise. ?
1160: be otherwise.
1161: (as how should it be so? How otherwise? ),
1162: true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
1163: half a year. But, by'r lady, he must build churches then; or else
1164: as by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
1165: Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
1166: Laer. What ceremony else?
1167: laer. What ceremony else?
1168: sense.
1169: as my great power thereof may give thee sense,
1170: or but a sickly part of one true sense
1171: as any the most vulgar thing to sense,
1172: whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
1173: else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
1174: that it is proof and bulwark against sense.
1175: hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
1176: in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
1177: shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose
1178: end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
1179: and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose
1180: the passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
1181: or with a little shuffling, you may choose
1182: How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
1183: What to ourselves in passion we propose,
1184: is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
1185: brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,
1186: calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
1187: was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
1188: and to such wondrous doing brought his horse
1189: when he lay couched in the ominous horse,
1190: Oph. Still better, and worse.
1191: in obstinate condolement is a course
1192: thee where i am. Rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course
1193: and with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
1194: Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
1195: I had my father's signet in my purse,
1196: of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
1197: whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
1198: for this effect defective comes by cause.
1199: like john-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
1200: that your good beauties be the happy cause
1201: doth rend the region; so, after pyrrhus' pause,
1202: sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet i could accuse
1203: that i have shot my arrow o'er the house
1204: to tell the secrets of my prison house,
1205: pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
1206: Ham. The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
1207: there was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
1208: If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
1209: Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
1210: But woe is me! You are so sick of late,
1211: What, have you given him any hard words of late?
1212: 'tis told me he hath very oft of late
1213: and our affairs from england come too late.
1214: King. [aside] it is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
1215: My liege, and madam, to expostulate
1216: Set your entreatments at a higher rate
1217: let me be no assistant for a state,
1218: fordo it own life. 'twas of some estate.
1219: th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
1220: the safety and health of this whole state,
1221: of his true state.
1222: so far from cheer and from your former state.
1223: th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
1224: this bodes some strange eruption to our state.
1225: as it doth well appear unto our state,
1226: The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
1227: as of a father; for let the world take note
1228: as vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
1229: or such ambiguous giving out, to note
1230: th' effect of what i wrote?
1231: the rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
1232: that else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
1233: eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
1234: What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
1235: for the demand of our neglected tribute.
1236: the pith and marrow of our attribute.
1237: the perfume and suppliance of a minute;
1238: Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
1239: Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
1240: look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
1241: give it an understanding but no tongue.
1242: Queen. What have i done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
1243: But break my heart, for i must hold my tongue!
1244: Enter prologue.
1245: This above all- to thine own self be true,
1246: King. [aside] o, 'tis too true!
1247: Hor. As i do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
1248: Pol. 'tis most true;
1249: collected from all simples that have virtue
1250: to make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
1251: occasion smiles upon a second leave.
1252: i'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
1253: Laer. I pray you give me leave.
1254: By the mass, i was about to say something! Where did i leave?
1255: Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
1256: Ham. So you must take your husbands. - begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
1257: Queen. What would she have?
1258: and makes us rather bear those ills we have
1259: rey. My lord, i have.
1260: would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
1261: first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have
1262: this, give these fellows some means to the king. They have
1263: who was in life a foolish peating knave.
1264: but he's an arrant knave.
1265: Why, what an ass am i! This is most brave,
1266: grave. ]
1267: Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
1268: Leaps in the grave.
1269: To outface me with leaping in her grave?
1270: is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
1271: and not have strew'd thy grave.
1272: Ham. Into my grave?
1273: Pol. It shall do well. But yet do i believe
1274: Hor. Before my god, i might not this believe
1275: reckon my groans; but that i love thee best, o most best, believe
1276: which we do tender as we dearly grieve
1277: pound! Didst perceive?
1278: those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
1279: they find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
1280: beck than i have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
1281: and thy commandment all alone shall live
1282: Ham. Nay, but to live
1283: bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
1284: taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
1285: Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
1286: i could not but by her. The other motive
1287: Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
1288: Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
1289: buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
1290: Anon, as patient as the female dove
1291: Fare you well, my dove!
1292: to contract- o- the time for- a- my behove,
1293: In youth when i did love, did love,
1294: i do receive your offer'd love like love,
1295: whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
1296: There lives within the very flame of love
1297: are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
1298: as meditation or the thoughts of love,
1299: This is the very ecstasy of love,
1300: and with no less nobility of love
1301: could not (with all their quantity of love)
1302: stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
1303: Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
1304: but never doubt i love.
1305: If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
1306: more grief to hide than hate to utter love.
1307: this mad young man. But so much was our love
1308: his love.
1309: receiv'd his love?
1310: Ham. As woman's love.
1311: from the fair forehead of an innocent love,
1312: Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
1313: Pol. Mad for thy love?
1314: Queen. The instances that second marriage move
1315: doubt that the sun doth move;
1316: yet the unshaped use of it doth move
1317: This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
1318: for 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
1319: as hardy as the nemean lion's nerve.
1320: after the danish sword, and thy free awe
1321: O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
1322: Guil. Faith, her privates we.
1323: no, not to stay the finding of the axe,
1324: no, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
1325: burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
1326: with an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
1327: he swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
1328: here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
1329: as day does to your eye.
1330: Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
1331: we shall express our duty in his eye;
1332: And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
1333: Ham. Ay, so, god b' wi' ye!
1334: I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
1335: King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
1336: Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
1337: hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
1338: Ham. [comes forward] what is he whose grief
1339: together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
1340: King. Laertes, i must commune with your grief,
1341: the origin and commencement of his grief
1342: of impious stubbornness. 'tis unmanly grief;
1343: By his cockle bat and' staff
1344: or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
1345: my head should be struck off.
1346: A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
1347: Enter hamlet and horatio afar off.
1348: Queen. Good hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
1349: are shot off.
1350: not off.
1351: if it be made of penetrable stuff;
1352: sir, - it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for england- if
1353: little. 'sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
1354: and live the purer with the other half,
1355: hyperion's curls; the front of jove himself;
1356: so much from th' understanding of himself,
1357: Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself
1358: the devil himself.
1359: excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
1360: It is a poison temper'd by himself.
1361: when down her weedy trophies and herself
1362: I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
1363: Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
1364: pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
1365: given private time to you, and you yourself
1366: and oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
1367: it sends some precious instance of itself
1368: Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
1369: being a thing immortal as itself?
1370: whose violent property fordoes itself
1371: with fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
1372: Hor. As thou art to thyself.
1373: Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't fast? Woo't tear thyself?
1374: purpose, confess thyself-
1375: where now it burns, marcellus and myself,
1376: must render up myself.
1377: how strange or odd soe'er i bear myself
1378: lives almost by his looks; and for myself, -
1379: Horatio! - or i do forget myself.
1380: that to laertes i forgot myself,
1381: Behind the arras i'll convey myself
1382: know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of
1383: very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
1384: altitude of a chopine. Pray god your voice, like a piece of
1385: his wife, baptista. You shall see anon. 'tis a knavish piece of
1386: Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
1387: fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of
1388: sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
1389: pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
1390: letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of
1391: Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of
1392: but with a crafty madness keeps aloof
1393: and that i see, in passages of proof,
1394: till doomsday. Go, get thee to yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
1395: Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
1396: Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'the murther of
1397: keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
1398: nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
1399: speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
1400: or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of
1401: than fly to others that we know not of?
1402: this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
1403: that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf,
1404: at his head a grass-green turf,
1405: until my eyelids will no longer wag.
1406: that he could nothing do but wish and beg
1407: virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
1408: Enter a king and a queen very lovingly; the queen embracing
1409: Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
1410: I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
1411: what company, at what expense; and finding
1412: Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
1413: neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
1414: confederate season, else no creature seeing;
1415: The king is a thing-
1416: more relative than this. The play's the thing
1417: Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
1418: tell me one thing.
1419: Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
1420: Ham. Nothing.
1421: did nothing.
1422: Ber. I have seen nothing.
1423: with forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
1424: that carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
1425: as one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
1426: roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
1427: Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
1428: There's such divinity doth hedge a king
1429: of a king?
1430: Queen. As kill a king?
1431: even in their promise, as it is a-making,
1432: grave-making?
1433: and can say nothing! No, not for a king,
1434: This man shall set me packing.
1435: they cry 'choose we! Laertes shall be king! '
1436: the king.
1437: comes armed through our watch, so like the king
1438: Mar. Is it not like the king?
1439: there is a play to-night before the king.
1440: Ber. Long live the king!
1441: Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the king.
1442: Ham. An earnest conjuration from the king,
1443: to lack discretion. Come, go we to the king.
1444: This is one lucianus, nephew to the king.
1445: But soft! But soft! Aside! Here comes the king-
1446: Then, venom, to thy work. Hurts the king.
1447: Ham. Nay, i know not. Is it the king?
1448: o thou vile king,
1449: For. Go, captain, from me greet the danish king.
1450: enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], king,
1451: Enter king.
1452: enter king.
1453: as 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
1454: that shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
1455: 'laertes shall be king! Laertes king! '
1456: both to my god and to my gracious king;
1457: Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
1458: At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
1459: Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
1460: That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
1461: Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
1462: when thou liest howling.
1463: in censure of his seeming.
1464: Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; i hear him coming.
1465: Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
1466: awake the god of day; and at his warning,
1467: shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
1468: Rey. Good my lord! [going. ]
1469: his silence will sit drooping.
1470: a chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
1471: The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
1472: Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
1473: ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
1474: light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
1475: The canker galls the infants of the spring
1476: Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
1477: Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
1478: Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
1479: a broken voice, and his whole function suiting
1480: forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
1481: and sure i am two men there are not living
1482: most generous, and free from all contriving,
1483: when i had seen this hot love on the wing
1484: nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
1485: If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
1486: Ham. Now might i do it pat, now he is praying;
1487: the puppets dallying.
1488: Therefore i have entreated him along,
1489: Pol. This is too long.
1490: the bird of dawning singeth all night long;
1491: Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
1492: ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
1493: Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
1494: believe so much in him, that he is young,
1495: are unwrung.
1496: but what, in faith, make you from wittenberg?
1497: in going back to school in wittenberg,
1498: I pray thee stay with us, go not to wittenberg.
1499: Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, guildenstern? Ah,
1500: Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
1501: Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
1502: Ham. Am i not i' th' right, old jephthah?
1503: will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
1504: and thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
1505: and cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
1506: do not itself unkennel in one speech,
1507: taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
1508: [to laertes] strengthen your patience in our last night's speech.
1509: plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
1510: his replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on, which
1511: my virtue or my plague, be it either which, -
1512: i'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
1513: assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the french
1514: I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the french,
1515: against the which he has impon'd, as i take it, six french
1516: If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
1517: craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
1518: appears before them and with solemn march
1519: and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
1520: Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
1521: out of his subject; and we here dispatch
1522: i your commission will forthwith dispatch,
1523: and i with them the third night kept the watch;
1524: (marcellus and bernardo) on their watch
1525: with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
1526: why this same strict and most observant watch
1527: hath clawed me in his clutch,
1528: a baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
1529: You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
1530: The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
1531: without the sensible and true avouch
1532: as if i had never been such.
1533: Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
1534: and then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
1535: form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
1536: The chariest maid is prodigal enough
1537: that swift as quicksilverr it courses through
1538: Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
1539: stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
1540: for, though i am not splenitive and rash,
1541: and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
1542: Sound a flourish. [enter trumpets and kettledrums. Danish
1543: as love between them like the palm might flourish,
1544: and for your part, ophelia, i do wish
1545: like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
1546: We'll put the matter to the present push. -
1547: Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
1548: it may be death.
1549: under the moon, can save the thing from death
1550: he should the bearers put to sudden death,
1551: why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
1552: (for which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
1553: but that the dread of something after death-
1554: He never gave commandment for their death.
1555: O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
1556: That i am guiltless of your father's death,
1557: with pestilent speeches of his father's death,
1558: which i have told thee, of my father's death.
1559: or thinking by our late dear brother's death
1560: King. Though yet of hamlet our dear brother's death
1561: had i but time (as this fell sergeant, death,
1562: to muddy death.
1563: is by a forged process of my death
1564: and hears it roar beneath.
1565: nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
1566: Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
1567: Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
1568: the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath,
1569: rawer breath
1570: Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
1571: yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
1572: his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
1573: that i shall live and tell him to his teeth,
1574: Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
1575: Hor. In faith,
1576: Mar. Nor i, my lord- in faith.
1577: Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'

1583: than i to hercules. Within a month,
1584: by what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
1585: rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
1586: giving more light than heat, extinct in both
1587: King. I do not fear it, i have seen you both;
1588: i cannot dream of. I entreat you both
1589: thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
1590: visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
1591: heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
1592: Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
1593: extorted treasure in the womb of earth
1594: Ham. Dost thou think alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
1595: Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;

1600: to hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
1601: i would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
1602: videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
1603: holding a weak supposal of our worth,

1605: Hor. Not from his mouth,
1606: make ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
1607: rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
1608: King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
1609: and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
1610: that unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
1611: What is between you? Give me up the truth.
1612: your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
1613: Pol. With what, i' th' name of god i
1614: How much i had to do to calm his rage i

1657: for murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
1658: Queen. Nay, then i'll set those to you that can speak.

1660: Hor. Of that i shall have also cause to speak,
1661: but from what cause he will by no means speak.
1662: and let the kettle to the trumpet speak,

1666: but what we do determine oft we break.

1668: Queen. Alack,
1669: and that his soul may be as damn'd and black
1670: nor customary suits of solemn black,
1671: so levied as before, against the polack;
1672: to be a preparation 'gainst the polack,
1673: of reverend priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.

1681: and with a larger tether may he walk
1682: wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
1683: and curd, like eager droppings into milk,

1711: claudius, king of denmark.
1712: a serpent stung me. So the whole ear of denmark
1713: Oph. Where is the beauteous majesty of denmark?
1714: Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all denmark
1715: for your succession in denmark?
1716: and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark.
1717: from whence though willingly i came to denmark

1728: doth all the noble substance often dout to his own scandal.
1729: King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
1730: which was the model of that danish seal;

1748: Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
1749: break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
1750: what's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
1751: that thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
1752: Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
1753: grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;

1758: Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
1759: Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
1760: Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
1761: memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
1762: The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
1763: from that particular fault. The dram of e'il
1764: when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
1765: into a toil?
1766: let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil

1785: Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
1786: His liberty is full of threats to all-
1787: the better to beguile. This is for all:

1793: or not at all.
1794: Pol. Madam, i swear i use no art at all.
1795: and bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
1796: what feast is toward in thine eternal cell

1801: O shame! Where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
1802: but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,

1828: Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
1829: Ham. I am glad to see you well.

1837: a silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
1838: let it be tenable in your silence still;
1839: Ham. It waves me still.
1840: and nothing is at a like goodness still;
1841: Ham. I will.
1842: Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will
1843: to show us so much gentry and good will
1844: Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
1845: no traveller returns- puzzles the will,

1866: Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
1867: Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
1868: Mar. O, wonderful!
1869: as we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
1870: and my imaginations are as foul
1871: Ham. O my prophetic soul!
1872: the inward service of the mind and soul
1873: she's so conjunctive to my life and soul

1876: and we shall jointly labour with your soul
1877: lay not that flattering unction to your soul

1901: help to hasten them?
1902: that, for some vicious mole of nature in them,

1916: Hor. A piece of him.
1917: Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
1918: ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
1919: Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
1920: to show his grief. Let her be round with him;
1921: Pray you be round with him.
1922: that, being of so young clays brought up with him,
1923: [grapples with him].
1924: no more to undertake it, i will work him
1925: him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
1926: we cannot get from him.
1927: did not together pluck such envy from him
1928: Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
1929: Must i remember? Why, she would hang on him
1930: that we with wisest sorrow think on him
1931: and thus a while the fit will work on him.
1932: You must not put another scandal on him,
1933: King. I pray thee, good horatio, wait upon him.
1934: addicted so and so'; and there put on him
1935: Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
1936: Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.

1946: Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
1947: 1. Play. 'anon he finds him,
1948: at his post; then] bernardo, [who approaches him].
1949: let his queen mother all alone entreat him
1950: King. Well, we shall sift him.
1951: more than his father's death, that thus hath put him
1952: Ham. Let me see. [takes the skull. ] alas, poor yorick! I knew him,
1953: Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
1954: Queen. Did you assay him
1955: Queen. But not by him!
1956: Mar. Let's follow. 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
1957: to bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
1958: I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
1959: a thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom

1988: to give the world assurance of a man.
1989: and spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
1990: Ham. As th'art a man,

2084: against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
2085: and now i'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
2086: O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
2087: it shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
2088: take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
2089: show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
2090: as oft as any passion under heaven
2091: then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
2092: Hor. Not i, my lord, by heaven!
2093: unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
2094: but never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
2095: will nothing stick our person to arraign
2096: again.
2097: I shall not look upon his like again.
2098: he never will come again.
2099: And will he not come again?
2100: and will he not come again?
2101: whose worth, if praises may go back again,
2102: Perchance 'twill walk again.
2103: Laer. Well, again!
2104: Mar. Peace! Break thee off! Look where it comes again!
2105: But soft! Behold! Lo, where it comes again!
2106: and the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
2107: now fear i this will give it start again;
2108: Enter ghost again.
2109: would have reverted to my bow again,
2110: will bring him to his wonted way again,
2111: Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
2112: that one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
2113: O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
2114: Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
2115: with this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
2116: Polonius, lord chamberlain.
2117: Pol. [behind] o, i am slain!
2118: that he which hath your noble father slain
2119: But in battalions! First, her father slain;
2120: Hamlet in madness hath polonius slain,
2121: laer. It is here, hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
2122: Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
2123: and we beseech you, bend you to remain
2124: and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
2125: Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
2126: Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
2127: within the book and volume of my brain,
2128: without more motive, into every brain
2129: Exeunt [all but the captain].
2130: A norwegian captain.
2131: Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
2132: hor. That is most certain.
2133: Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
2134: Queen. O hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
2135: And never come mischance between us twain!
2136: Ham. Up from my cabin,
2137: receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
2138: his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in
2139: Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
2140: valanc'd since i saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
2141: Hor. Let them come in.
2142: Queen. Let her come in.
2143: A noise within: 'let her come in. '
2144: All. No, let's come in!
2145: to his confine; and of the truth herein
2146: twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
2147: piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! How infinite in
2148: especially where he speaks of priam's slaughter. If it live in
2149: 'now the king drinks to hamlet. ' come, begin.
2150: and, as the world were now but to begin,
2151: i stand in pause where i shall first begin,
2152: since nature cannot choose his origin, -
2153: of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
2154: [exit the queen. Then] exit hamlet, tugging in
2155: is very cunning in.
2156: give, me superfluous death. A noise within.
2157: a noise within.
2158: [drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
2159: [march within. ]
2160: whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
2161: to tell my story. [march afar off, and shot within. ]
2162: Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
2163: Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
2164: your bounty. Take them in.
2165: King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
2166: ham. I dare not confess that, lest i should compare with him in
2167: Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into france i have been in
2168: and after we will both our judgments join
2169: Ham. My lord, i have news to tell you. When roscius was an actor in
2170: honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in
2171: cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
2172: King. Our son shall win.
2173: How now o what hath befall'n?
2174: Such was the very armour he had on
2175: i had forgot! 'tis so concluded on.
2176: and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
2177: Give us the foils. Come on.
2178: and he not from his reason fall'n thereon
2179: and prologue to the omen coming on,
2180: in honourable fashion.
2181: a scullion!
2182: but, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
2183: Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
2184: thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
2185: but in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
2186: into a tow'ring passion.
2187: had he the motive and the cue for passion
2188: against their own succession.
2189: when we would bring him on to some confession
2190: hold up adam's profession.
2191: get from him why he puts on this confusion,
2192: I'll cross it, though it blast me. - stay illusion!
2193: this present object made probation.
2194: that flesh is heir to. 'tis a consummation
2195: Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
2196: and gem of all the nation.
2197: Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
2198: i have in quick determination
2199: to show my duty in your coronation,
2200: if one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
2201: The very place puts toys of desperation,
2202: amazement and admiration.
2203: Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
2204: no noble rite nor formal ostentation, -
2205: and they in france of the best rank and station
2206: him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
2207: seeks her own salvation?
2208: innovation.
2209: Mar. Look with what courteous action
2210: who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
2211: and keep you in the rear of your affection,
2212: and could of men distinguish, her election
2213: discretion.
2214: according to the phrase or the addition
2215: Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
2216: why should we in our peevish opposition
2217: so horridly to shake our disposition
2218: Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
2219: that might your nature, honour, and exception
2220: shall in the general censure take corruption
2221: went to cuffs in the question.
2222: Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
2223: by this encompassment and drift of question
2224: that i must call't in question.
2225: But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
2226: and thus the native hue of resolution
2227: about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,
2228: by the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
2229: Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
2230: for what we know must be, and is as common
2231: Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
2232: and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
2233: to put an antic disposition on),
2234: and his sandal shoon.
2235: Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
2236: revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
2237: if she unmask her beauty to the moon.
2238: my custom always of the afternoon,
2239: Ham. 'tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon. -
2240: Ham. What's his weapon?
2241: Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
2242: Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
2243: All. Treason! Treason!
2244: that capability and godlike reason
2245: (o god! A beast that wants discourse of reason
2246: oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
2247: which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
2248: now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
2249: fay, i cannot reason.
2250: Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
2251: demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son
2252: start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
2253: or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
2254: Ham. Denmark's a prison.
2255: deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison
2256: Let him go, gertrude. Do not fear our person.
2257: Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
2258: our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
2259: good gertrude, set some watch over your son. -
2260: Where is your son?
2261: than that which dearest father bears his son
2262: But now, my cousin hamlet, and my son-
2263: You laying these slight sullies on my son
2264: On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
2265: for he was likely, had he been put on,
2266: Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard. - prithee say on.
2267: For. Go softly on.
2268: Enter king, rosencrantz, and guildenstern.
2269: Enter king and queen, with rosencrantz and guildenstern.
2270: King. Welcome, dear rosencrantz and guildenstern.
2271: Enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.
2272: Enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.
2273: Enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.
2274: enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.
2275: Enter polonius, rosencrantz, and guildenstern.
2276: Exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern]
2277: Exeunt [rosencrantz and guildenstern].
2278: Exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern.
2279: [exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
2280: [exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern. ]
2281: King. Thanks, rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern.
2282: both countenance and excuse. Ho, guildenstern!
2283: the cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
2284: since frost itself as actively doth burn,
2285: the undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
2286: occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
2287: your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
2288: himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
2289: But, orderly to end where i begun,
2290: our wills and fates do so contrary run
2291: Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
2292: 'so would i 'a' done, by yonder sun,
2293: and thrice his head thus waving up and down,
2294: Enter two sentinels-[first, ] francisco, [who paces up and down
2295: they had begun the play. I sat me down;
2296: th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
2297: Hor. Well, sit we down,
2298: Lord. The king and queen and all are coming down.
2299: and, as he drains his draughts of rhenish down,
2300: and break your own neck down.
2301: as therein are set down.
2302: My tables! Meet it is i set it down
2303: Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! Sit you down
2304: Enter the ghost in his nightgown.
2305: with an entreaty, herein further shown,

2307: antiquity forgot, custom not known,
2308: as are companions noted and most known
2309: now wears his crown.
2310: Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
2311: as if increase of appetite had grown
2312: deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
2313: Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
2314: that our devices still are overthrown;
2315: our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
2316: desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own
2317: his greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
2318: and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
2319: No.
2320: Laer. No.
2321: Oph. You must sing 'a-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a. ' o,
2322: Ber. 'tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, francisco.
2323: dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
2324: that he should weep for her? What would he do,
2325: Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?
2326: Queen. What shall i do?
2327: Enter polonius and reynaldo.
2328: Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good reynaldo,
2329: Pol. Give him this money and these notes, reynaldo.
2330: and in part him. ' do you mark this, reynaldo?
2331: Exit reynaldo.
2332: If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, i will do
2333: my operant powers their functions leave to do.
2334: my stern effects. Then what i have to do
2335: and let them know both what we mean to do
2336: why yet i live to say 'this thing's to do, '
2337: that you know aught of me- this is not to do,
2338: Fran. Bernardo?
2339: Mar. Holla, bernardo!
2340: Enter horatio, marcellus, and bernardo.
2341: players do, i had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
2342: He may not, as unvalued persons do,
2343: do not as some ungracious pastors do,
2344: I once did hold it, as our statists do,
2345: Ham. 'swounds, show me what thou't do.
2346: Ham. Not this, by no means, that i bid you do:
2347: O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
2348: gonzago'?
2349: Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's gonzago.
2350: and end his being. That done, he lets me go,
2351: I do beseech you give him leave to go.
2352: as infinite as man may undergo-
2353: But let that go.
2354: which bewept to the grave did not go
2355: Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
2356: why to a public count i might not go
2357: O, ho!
2358: Ham. Saw? Who?
2359: Osr. Look to the queen there, ho!
2360: Help, help, ho!
2361: Lord. My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young osric, who
2362: Ham. Between who?
2363: tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
2364: Enter hamlet and horatio.
2365: Exeunt all but hamlet and horatio.
2366: their grand commission; where i found, horatio
2367: but i am very sorry, good horatio,
2368: favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, horatio,
2369: Ham. O, i die, horatio!
2370: Ham. In my mind's eye, horatio.
2371: And what make you from wittenberg, horatio?
2372: [retires with horatio. ]
2373: There are more things in heaven and earth, horatio,
2374: Ham. What, ho, horatio!
2375: Enter horatio.
2376: Ham. Yes, by saint patrick, but there is, horatio,
2377: Ber. Looks it not like the king? Mark it, horatio.
2378: Mar. Question it, horatio.
2379: Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, horatio.
2380: Exit horatio.
2381: [exit horatio. ]
2382: or ever i had seen that day, horatio!
2383: Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
2384: Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
2385: scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no
2386: Ham. How if i answer no?
2387: if't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
2388: me, whether you were sent for or no.
2389: more than their even-christen. Come, my spade! There is no
2390: Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
2391: discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
2392: Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- hercules and his load too.
2393: Ham. The point envenom'd too?
2394: Hor. Let him bless thee too.
2395: to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
2396: importing denmark's health, and england's too,
2397: very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
2398: Hor. Ay, my lord, and of calveskins too.
2399: King. Sweet gertrude, leave us too;
2400: monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
2401: King. Faith, i must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
2402: Other. Why, 'tis found so.
2403: King. It shall be so.
2404: Laer. Let this be so.
2405: Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
2406: as he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
2407: christians, nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man, have so
2408: Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
2409: Hor. E'en so.
2410: Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
2411: Osr. Shall i redeliver you e'en so?
2412: such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
2413: Hor. 'twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
2414: mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
2415: and as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
2416: that i have positively said ''tis so, '
2417: promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
2418: i do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
2419: if damned custom have not braz'd it so
2420: the rather, if you could devise it so
2421: Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
2422: Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
2423: Oph. No more but so?
2424: and let him know so.
2425: neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
2426: Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
2427: Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
2428: Ber. It would be spoke to.
2429: my good friends, i'll leave you till night. You are welcome to
2430: He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
2431: will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to
2432: ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
2433: soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
2434: other. Go to!
2435: Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
2436: brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
2437: bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to
2438: Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
2439: Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
2440: Lord. The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
2441: have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
2442: 'o dear ophelia, i am ill at these numbers; i have not art to
2443: But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
2444: Ham. Bid the players make haste, [exit polonius. ] will you two
2445: Both. We will, my lord. Exeunt they two.
2446: Ham. Lady, shall i lie in your lap?
2447: Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
2448: Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
2449: and how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
2450: the tedious day with sleep.
2451: devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
2452: and by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
2453: and convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
2454: for some must watch, while some must sleep:
2455: Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
2456: to try conclusions, in the basket creep
2457: Ham. Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
2458: Hor. Hail to your lordship!
2459: Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
2460: Oph. What means your lordship?
2461: Pol. [behind] what, ho! Help, help, help!
2462: for out o' doors he went without their help
2463: The bark is ready and the wind at help,
2464: No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
2465: sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
2466: seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
2467: unpeg the basket on the house's top,
2468: Give him the cup.
2469: you mainly were stirr'd up.
2470: or pardon'd being down? Then i'll look up;
2471: find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
2472: and, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
2473: Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
2474: a blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
2475: with a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
2476: For thou dost know, o damon dear,
2477: Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
2478: and i'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
2479: all given to mine ear.
2480: Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
2481: Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
2482: almost to jelly with the act of fear,
2483: Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
2484: for we will fetters put upon this fear,
2485: the virtue of his will; but you must fear,
2486: sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
2487: Ham. For god's love let me hear!
2488: Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
2489: Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
2490: King. O, speak of that! That do i long to hear.
2491: since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
2492: Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
2493: wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, hamlet, hear.
2494: Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
2495: where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
2496: how these things came about. So shall you hear
2497: The glowworm shows the matin to be near
2498: Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
2499: Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
2500: and wants not buzzers to infect his ear
2501: and in his grave rain'd many a tear.
2502: Ghost. Swear.
2503: as peace should still her wheaten garland wear
2504: swear.
2505: Ghost. [beneath] swear.
2506: Ghost. [beneath] swear.
2507: Consent to swear.
2508: [they swear. ]
2509: you nine year.
2510: drabbing. You may go so far.
2511: he knew me not at first. He said i was a fishmonger. He is far
2512: the guts of a beggar.
2513: we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar
2514: Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
2515: doubt truth to be a liar;
2516: being nature's livery, or fortune's star,

3398: King. What, gertrude? How does hamlet?
3399: Ghost beckons hamlet.
3400: Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, hamlet.
3401: No more, sweet hamlet!
3402: Queen. Hamlet, hamlet!
3403: dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant hamlet
3404: Exeunt [all but hamlet].
3405: Flourish. Exeunt all but hamlet.
3406: [exeunt all but hamlet. ]
3407: [exeunt all but hamlet. ]
3408: Queen. Why, how now, hamlet?
3409: King. Ay, hamlet.
3410: But you'll be secret?
3411: The queen's closet.
3412: Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
3413: oph. My lord, as i was sewing in my closet,
3414: and with a sudden vigour it doth posset
3415: pays homage to us, - thou mayst not coldly set
3416: and therefore i forbid my tears; but yet
3417: and scape detecting, i will pay the theft.
3418: Here's yet some liquor left.
3419: Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
3420: Ham. Haste me to know't, that i, with wings as swift
3421: Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
3422: from our achievements, though perform'd at height,
3423: By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
3424: that lend a tyrannous and a damned light
3425: Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
3426: prais'd my lord such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it- might
3427: or 'if we list to speak, ' or 'there be, an if they might, '
3428: sport and repose lock from me day and night,
3429: with wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
3430: Ber. Well, good night.
3431: the death i gave him. So again, good night.
3432: Fran. Give you good night.
3433: in the dead vast and middle of the night
3434: doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
3435: 'tis now the very witching time of night,
3436: Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
3437: Delay it not; i'll have him hence to-night.
3438: Hold you the watch to-night?
3439: Ham. I will watch to-night.
3440: let us impart what we have seen to-night
3441: Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
3442: ah, mine own lord, what have i seen to-night!
3443: Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
3444: that aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
3445: and whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
3446: Hor. My lord, i think i saw him yesternight.
3447: with us to watch the minutes of this night,
3448: your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
3449: thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
3450: Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
3451: King. It falls right.
3452: that ever i was born to set it right!
3453: or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
3454: and vanish'd from our sight.
3455: if you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
3456: Fort. Where is this sight?
3457: Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
3458: and, england, if my love thou hold'st at aught, -
3459: I never gave you aught.
3460: Pol. Marry, well bethought!
3461: indeed would make one think there might be thought,
3462: but answer made it none. Yet once methought
3463: But in our circumstance and course of thought,
3464: is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
3465: with the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
3466: termagant. It out-herods herod. Pray you avoid it.
3467: sir, though i most powerfully and potently believe, yet i hold it
3468: Ham. Why, then the polack never will defend it.
3469: Ham. Yours, yours. [exit osric. ] he does well to commend it
3470: Rey. My lord, i did intend it.
3471: imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it
3472: Ham. So be it!
3473: very liberal conceit.
3474: could force his soul so to his own conceit
3475: excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
3476: so by his father lost; and this, i take it,
3477: a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
3478: it fits your wisdom so far to believe it
3479: Hor. Never believe it.
3480: Ham. Do not believe it.
3481: Hor. So have i heard and do in part believe it.
3482: And, sister, as the winds give benefit
3483: time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
3484: and draw you into madness? Think of it.
3485: Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
3486: i chiefly lov'd. 'twas aeneas' tale to dido, and thereabout of it
3487: to let you know of it.
3488: and you yourself shall keep the key of it.
3489: which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
3490: repair hither and say you are not fit.
3491: we would not understand what was most fit,
3492: and will not wrong it.
3493: than your particular demands will touch it.
3494: If hamlet give the first or second hit,
3495: Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
3496: Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
3497: But do not go with it!
3498: Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
3499: Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
3500: Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it. -
3501: Ham. No, you will reveal it.
3502: of hamlet's transformation. So i call it,
3503: bet against the danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?
3504: Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
3505: To pay five ducats, five, i would not farm it;
3506: so mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
3507: A table and flagons of wine on it.
3508: he may approve our eyes and speak to it.
3509: Ham. Did you not speak to it?
3510: conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
3511: but truly i do fear it.
3512: Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
3513: Guil. The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
3514: Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
3515: The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
3516: and am most sensibly in grief for it,
3517: Thus much the business is: we have here writ
3518: Ham. Whose was it?
3519: then hamlet does it not, hamlet denies it.
3520: And i beseech you instantly to visit
3521: is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
3522: the hearers to collection; they aim at it,
3523: Hor. Heaven will direct it.
3524: Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
3525: Ham. It will not speak. Then will i follow it.
3526: It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
3527: Exit.
3528: Exit.
3529: Exit.
3530: Exit.
3531: Exit.
3532: Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. Exit.
3533: wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king. Exit.
3534: my thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! Exit.
3535: Laer. Farewell. Exit.
3536: howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. Exit.
3537: Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Exit.
3538: they are. To a nunnery, go. Exit.
3539: Pol. I will say so. Exit.
3540: This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. Exit.
3541: ladies. Good night, good night. Exit
3542: Give you good night. Exit.
3543: but that this folly douts it. Exit.
3544: to give them seals never, my soul, consent! Exit.
3545: Capt. God b' wi' you, sir. [exit. ]
3546: we beg your hearing patiently. [exit. ]
3547: King. We will try it.
3548: King. I do not think't.
3549: O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
3550: Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
3551: it spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
3552: observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
3553: So full of artless jealousy is guilt
3554: calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
3555: of general assault.
3556: Enter horatio with an attendant.
3557: lords attendant.
3558: queen, laertes, with lords attendant. ]
3559: [exit attendant. ]
3560: Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
3561: and they can well on horseback; but this gallant
3562: Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
3563: Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
3564: and i believe it is a fetch of warrant.
3565: against yourself. I know you are no truant.
3566: and here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
3567: th' associates tend, and everything is bent
3568: grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
3569: and call it accident.
3570: Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
3571: Hor. [aside to hamlet] i knew you must be edified by the margent
3572: Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
3573: how in my words somever she be shent,
3574: a heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
3575: Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
3576: Ham. Sir, i lack advancement.
3577: i stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
3578: Ham. Judgment!
3579: I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
3580: divided from herself and her fair-judgment,
3581: and waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
3582: take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
3583: but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
3584: and enterprises of great pith and moment
3585: is not to stir without great argument,
3586: this grave shall have a living monument.
3587: Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
3588: contagious blastments are most imminent.
3589: which is not tomb enough and continent
3590: Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
3591: spent.
3592: Haply the seas, and countries different,
3593: very day that young hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
3594: upon his will i seal'd my hard consent.
3595: against the which a moiety competent
3596: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
3597: do i impart toward you. For your intent
3598: to give it due content.
3599: was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
3600: makes mouths at the invisible event,
3601: of thinking too precisely on th' event, -
3602: will be some danger; which for to prevent,
3603: Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
3604: Pol. [aside] though this be madness, yet there is a method in't. -
3605: King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
3606: sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't
3607: that has no relish of salvation in't-
3608: this is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
3609: Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
3610: on't.
3611: Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, i'll make an end on't!
3612: it hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
3613: What think you on't?
3614: from fashion of himself. What think you on't?
3615: i have sworn't.
3616: should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
3617: Exeunt.
3618: Exeunt.
3619: Exeunt.
3620: Exeunt.
3621: Exeunt.
3622: Exeunt.
3623: Exeunt.
3624: Exeunt.
3625: Exeunt.
3626: Exeunt
3627: to him from whom you brought them. Exeunt.
3628: Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Exeunt.
3629: where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt.
3630: no reckoning made, but sent to my account
3631: fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
3632: Clown. To't.
3633: Laer. I will do't!
3634: epitaph is 'for o, for o, the hobby-horse is forgot! '
3635: that thou so many princes at a shot
3636: Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
3637: go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
3638: cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
3639: not.
3640: ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
3641: Laer. O, fear me not!
3642: King. I have nothing with this answer, hamlet. These words are not
3643: to you in satisfaction; but if not,
3644: a brother's murther! Pray can i not,
3645: Both. My lord, we will not.
3646: Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; i saw them not.
3647: of all their conference. If she find him not,
3648: Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
3649: Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
3650: Guil. My lord, i cannot.
3651: Guil. Believe me, i cannot.
3652: Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- i cannot
3653: Ham. Sir, i cannot.
3654: Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but i cannot
3655: Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
3656: him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
3657: looking before and after, gave us not
3658: Ham. Nay, that follows not.
3659: it not?
3660: Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
3661: Try what repentance can. What can it not?
3662: Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
3663: might it not?
3664: continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
3665: Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
3666: insert in't, could you not?
3667: shall you my son. You have me, have you not
3668: Hor. In what particular thought to work i know not;
3669: Ham. Nay, i know not.
3670: Ham. To what base uses we may return, horatio! Why may not
3671: Ros. No indeed are they not.
3672: I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
3673: with heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
3674: Both. My lord, from head to foot.
3675: Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
3676: Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
3677: Young men will do't if they come to't
3678: as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
3679: Hor. So guildenstern and rosencrantz go to't.
3680: 'as by lot, god wot, '
3681: Ghost. I find thee apt;
3682: a face without a heart, '
3683: The head is not more native to the heart,
3684: in my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
3685: there's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
3686: this something-settled matter in his heart,
3687: and i am sick at heart.
3688: If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
3689: And shall i couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
3690: It warms the very sickness in my heart
3691: Ham. Nay, but swear't.
3692: The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
3693: had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
3694: But farewell it, for i will use no art.
3695: or you deny me right. Go but apart,
3696: i hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
3697: We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
3698: sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
3699: Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, i should impart
3700: thy knotted and combined locks to part,
3701: such as it is; and for my own poor part,
3702: Queen. More matter, with less art.
3703: Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
3704: Pol. My lord, i will use them according to their desert.
3705: lest with this piteous action you convert
3706: a chough; but, as i say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
3707: to make it truster of your own report
3708: and gave you such a masterly report
3709: and with a look so piteous in purport
3710: when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport
3711: that she should lock herself from his resort,
3712: as it is common for the younger sort
3713: King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
3714: to hear of it. They are here about the court,
3715: that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
3716: Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
3717: 'the rugged pyrrhus, like th' hyrcanian beast-'
3718: My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
3719: Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
3720: fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
3721: Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
3722: will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
3723: by laboursome petition, and at last
3724: all saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
3725: to serve in such a difference. What devil was't
3726: Laer. A norman was't?
3727: a couch for luxury and damned incest.
3728: the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
3729: A priest.
3730: may violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
3731: and when you are desirous to be blest,
3732: Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
3733: Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
3734: queen. O, confound the rest!
3735: and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
3736: that i have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
3737: give me one poor request.
3738: This heavy-headed revel east and west
3739: to ears of flesh and blood. List, list, o, list!
3740: the ocean, overpeering of his list,
3741: Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
3742: Enter ghost.
3743: enter ghost.
3744: Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
3745: Exit ghost.
3746: Exit ghost.
3747: Exit ghost.
3748: as made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
3749: Laer. And so have i a noble father lost;
3750: whose motive in this case should stir me most
3751: servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, i am most
3752: she married. O, most wicked speed, to post
3753: None wed the second but who killed the first.
3754: Exeunt polonius and players [except the first].
3755: dungeons, denmark being one o' th' worst.
3756: When second husband let me be accurst!
3757: Laer. A touch, a touch; i do confess't.
3758: seek for thy noble father in the dust.
3759: so to seduce! - won to his shameful lust
3760: discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
3761: most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
3762: That i distrust you. Yet, though i distrust,
3763: and a most instant tetter bark'd about,
3764: them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
3765: that inward breaks, and shows no cause without
3766: Laer. Where is this king? - sirs, staid you all without.
3767: the trumpet to the cannoneer without,
3768: and either [master] the devil, or throw him out
3769: make you to ravel all this matter out,
3770: when churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
3771: Ham. My fate cries out
3772: by indirections find directions out.
3773: philosophy could find it out.
3774: Treachery! Seek it out.
3775: the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
3776: Hor. Not when i saw't.
3777: it. Adieu.
3778: I am dead, horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
3779: Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
3780: The story is extant, and written in very choice italian. You
3781: them. Let the king have the letters i have sent, and repair thou
3782: i'll rant as well as thou.
3783: for husband shalt thou-
3784: Ham. O jephthah, judge of israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
3785: 'thus didest thou. '
3786: so, proceed you.
3787: inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
3788: Who hath reliev'd you?
3789: Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
3790: Moreover that we much did long to see you,
3791: to let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
3792: to whom he more adheres. If it will please you
3793: pol. Ophelia, walk you here. - gracious, so please you,
3794: there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you
3795: Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
3796: my too much changed son. - go, some of you,
3797: my leave of you.
3798: King. He made confession of you;
3799: where you may see the inmost part of you.
3800: given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
3801: Hor. I beseech you.
3802: Ham. I do beseech you.
3803: Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
3804: Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
3805: Ham. Sir, my good friend- i'll change that name with you.
3806: and he to england shall along with you.
3807: And now, laertes, what's the news with you?
3808: Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
3809: your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
3810: And of all christian souls, i pray god. God b' wi', you.
3811: Ham. Beggar that i am, i am even poor in thanks; but i thank you;
3812: had it th' ability of life to thank you.
3813: mark you,
3814: is strict in his arrest) o, i could tell you-
3815: it is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
3816: Pol. My lord, i have news to tell you.
3817: and that in way of caution- i must tell you
3818: but let me hear from you.
3819: King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
3820: Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
3821: Both. We'll wait upon you.
3822: good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
3823: for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again. - what do you
3824: what i have said to you.
3825: Pol. What is't, ophelia, he hath said to you?
3826: with all my love i do commend me to you;
3827: Clown. 'tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
3828: hath sent me to you.
3829: may do t' express his love and friending to you,
3830: this marvel to you.
3831: King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
3832: Ham. Speak the speech, i pray you, as i pronounc'd it to you,
3833: so grace and mercy at your most need help you,
3834: my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother, you
3835: Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
3836: Sailor. 'a shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
3837: Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
3838: have sent for you.
3839: whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
3840: before my daughter told me), what might you,
3841: i'll visit you.
3842: you, as your business and desires shall point you,
3843: Ham. I pray you.
3844: king. Follow her close; give her good watch, i pray you.
3845: Ham. How purpos'd, sir, i pray you?
3846: Ham. Arm'd, say you?
3847: Come. (they play. ) another hit. What say you?
3848: Ros. [aside to guildenstern] what say you?
3849: King. Who shall stay you?
3850: Queen. I shall obey you;
3851: Scene v.
3852: Scene v.
3853: Scene iv.
3854: Scene iv.
3855: Scene iv.
3856: the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
3857: lost by his father, with all bands of law,
3858: should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
3859: Other. But is this law?
3860: Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
3861: dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
3862: but greatly to find quarrel in a straw
3863: will not debate the question of this straw.
3864: know a hawk from a handsaw.
3865: thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
3866: high on a stage be placed to the view;
3867: Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
3868: finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
3869: Hor. 'twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
3870: But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
3871: Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
3872: it is but a shadow's shadow.
3873: and i a maid at your window,
3874: but i have that within which passeth show-
3875: not of that dye which their investments show,
3876: through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
3877: the bold winds speechless, and the orb below
3878: King. [rises] my words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
3879: a rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
3880: therefore let's follow.
3881: the queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
3882: of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
3883: how should i your true-love know
3884: Let's do't, i pray; and i this morning know
3885: King. Not that i know.
3886: and tell you what i know.
3887: but mad in craft. 'twere good you let him know;
3888: Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
3889: and prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
3890: and ever three parts coward, - i do not know
3891: Oph. My lord, i do not know,
3892: it did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
3893: Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
3894: and then, you know,
3895: Laer. My lord, i'll hit him now.
3896: Ham. What's the matter now?
3897: how to forget that learning; but, sir, now
3898: Ham. What hour now?
3899: i be so able as now.
3900: (sings) white his shroud as the mountain snow-
3901: His beard was as white as snow,
3902: Ham. If she should break it now!
3903: See you now-
3904: grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
3905: Laer. Have at you now!
3906: and lose the name of action. - soft you now!
3907: and, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
3908: See what a grace was seated on this brow;
3909: sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
3910: does by their own insinuation grow.
3911: hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
3912: and in the cup an union shall he throw
3913: And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
3914: Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
3915: Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
3916: bears such an emphasis? Whose phrase of sorrow
3917: that it went hand in hand even with the vow
3918: to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
3919: that roars so loud and thunders in the index?
3920: translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
3921: Ber. Say-
3922: how does your honour for this many a day?
3923: doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
3924: and do such bitter business as the day
3925: and it must follow, as the night the day,
3926: from the first corse till he that died to-day,
3927: no jocund health that denmark drinks to-day
3928: I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
3929: (sings) to-morrow is saint valentine's day,
3930: the cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
3931: the changeling never known. Now, the next day
3932: Laer. Say you so? Come on. Play.
3933: Imperious caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
3934: the pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
3935: that would not let me sleep. Methought i lay
3936: that guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
3937: the hart ungalled play;
3938: Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
3939: Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
3940: King. What do you call the play?
3941: Pol. Give o'er the play.
3942: but if you hold it fit, after the play
3943: Prepare to play.
3944: laertes before you fall to play.
3945: Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
3946: for they are actions that a man might play;
3947: Laer. Come, my lord. They play.
3948: and will this brother's wager frankly play.
3949: pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
3950: Let hercules himself do what he may,
3951: till our scale turn the beam. O rose of may!
3952: with all his crimes broad blown, as flush as may;
3953: My soul is full of discord and dismay.
3954: Oph. Madam, i wish it may.
3955: that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
3956: and still your fingers on your lips, i pray.
3957: look you, i'll go pray.
3958: say-
3959: O, say!
3960: Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- what was i about to say?
3961: art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
3962: or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
3963: answer is i can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
3964: i' th' university, you say?
3965: gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as i may say)
3966: Clown. Very strangely, they say.
3967: King. Give me some light! Away!
3968: thus runs the world away.
3969: might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
3970: respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
3971: King. O gertrude, come away!
3972: and hit the woundless air. - o, come away!
3973: and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
3974: Pol. Away, i do beseech you, both away
3975: If hamlet from himself be taken away,
3976: Ber. See, it stalks away!
3977: Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
3978: Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
3979: Osr. Nothing neither way.
3980: for bearers of this greeting to old norway,
3981: Fortinbras, prince of norway.
3982: was, as you know, by fortinbras of norway,
3983: Say, voltemand, what from our brother norway?
3984: they bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
3985: pol. Marry, i will teach you! Think yourself a baby
3986: here in the lobby.
3987: the stair, into the lobby.
3988: top of my bent. - i will come by-and-by.
3989: Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
3990: that, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
3991: the very cause of hamlet's lunacy.
3992: with turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
3993: No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
3994: that you do bend your eye on vacancy,
3995: so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
3996: here stooping to your clemency,
3997: that he is open to incontinency.
3998: Ham. Well, god-a-mercy.
3999: to wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
4000: Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
4001: Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
4002: thou know'st already.
4003: the players ready.
4004: make you ready.
4005: One word more, good lady.
4006: (sings) he is dead and gone, lady,
4007: Ham. How is it with you, lady?
4008: King. How do you, pretty lady?
4009: Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
4010: that, open'd, lies within our remedy.
4011: For if the king like not the comedy,
4012: pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
4013: here was a gentleman of normandy.
4014: Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
4015: King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
4016: the natural gates and alleys of the body,
4017: Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
4018: Ham. The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
4019: all my smooth body.
4020: and makes each petty artire in this body
4021: with which she followed my poor father's body
4022: unto the voice and yielding of that body
4023: why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
4024: but not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
4025: Guil. But we both obey,
4026: ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They
4027: they?
4028: Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
4029: [laertes wounds hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
4030: this warlike volley.
4031: Ham. Why,
4032: Ham. Why,
4033: Ham. Why?
4034: than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
4035: humanity so abominably.
4036: Ham. I embrace it freely,
4037: subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
4038: Ham. How strangely?
4039: th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
4040: Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
4041: on wholesome life usurp immediately.
4042: waterfly?
4043: Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
4044: argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
4045: worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
4046: though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
4047: yes, faith, heartily.
4048: Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
4049: Ham. Come for the third, laertes! You but dally.
4050: tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
4051: and for your rapier most especially,
4052: Clown. Is she to be buried in christian burial when she wilfully
4053: for good polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
4054: out of my weakness and my melancholy,
4055: King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
4056: most free in his reply.
4057: appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
4058: which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
4059: you do not understand yourself so clearly
4060: Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
4061: Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
4062: with this contagion, that, if i gall him slightly,
4063: Hor. Most constantly.
4064: Pol. My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
4065: Pol. And the queen too, and that presently.
4066: been struck so to the soul that presently
4067: That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
4068: directly seasons him his enemy.
4069: his madness is poor hamlet's enemy.
4070: Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my
4071: Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
4072: feather. I have of late- but wherefore i know not- lost all my
4073: pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
4074: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
4075: willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
4076: i will win for him if i can; if not, i will gain nothing but my
4077: heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? For, by my
4078: Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many
4079: and hath abatements and delays as many
4080: Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
4081: Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
4082: (hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
4083: Clown. Why, here in denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy
4084: have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
4085: and there did seem in him a kind of joy
4086: each opposite that blanks the face of joy
4087: Whereon old norway, overcome with joy,
4088: The violence of either grief or joy
4089: [sings] for bonny sweet robin is all my joy.
4090: their own enactures with themselves destroy.
4091: meet what i would have well, and it destroy,
4092: Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
4093: spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
4094: as england was his faithful tributary,
4095: Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
4096: When in your motion you are hot and dry-
4097: glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry
4098: well ratified by law and heraldry,
4099: and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
4100: I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
4101: and our vain blows malicious mockery.
4102: he likewise gives a frock or livery,
4103: Purpose is but the slave to memory,
4104: And these few precepts in thy memory
4105: Yea, from the table of my memory
4106: Ham. Sir, a whole history.
4107: that are so fortified against our story,
4108: pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- ay, marry!
4109: Ham. O god, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
4110: that does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
4111: and who in want a hollow friend doth try,
4112: of man and country-
4113: a station like the herald mercury
4114: there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
4115: with this regard their currents turn awry
4116: Ham. If thou dost marry, i'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
4117: to the next abstinence; the next more easy;
4118: Is not this something more than fantasy?
4119: Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
4120: Ham. Ecstasy?
4121: This bodiless creation ecstasy
4122: for goodness, growing to a plurisy,
4123: and meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
4124: than to entreaty.
4125: king. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety, -
4126: tragedians of the city.
4127: of violent birth, but poor validity;
4128: and that in hamlet's hearing, for a quality
4129: gone, far gone! And truly in my youth i suff'red much extremity
4130: in neither aught, or in extremity.
4131: from me, whose love was of that dignity
4132: passing through nature to eternity.
4133: to his unmast'red importunity.
4134: That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
4135: [sings] by gis and by saint charity,
4136: for women's fear and love holds quantity,
4137: as in their birth, - wherein they are not guilty,
4138: if you desire to know the certainty
4139: to youth and liberty.
4140: that they may seem the taints of liberty,
4141: thy natural magic and dire property
4142: that blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
4143: Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
4144: the lives of many. The cesse of majesty
4145: that live and feed upon your majesty.
4146: to give th' assay of arms against your majesty.
4147: Ham. Sir, i will walk here in the hall. If it please his majesty,
4148: a thing to you from his majesty.
4149: Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
4150: musty.
4151: Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
4152: over the nasty sty!
4153: discourse to your beauty.
4154: as needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
4155: and we did think it writ down in our duty
4156: Cor. , volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
4157: farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
4158: Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
4159: did hamlet so envenom with his envy
4160: march. [enter king, queen, polonius, ophelia, rosencrantz,
4161: Queen. Thanks, guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz.
4162: Enter rosencrantz.
4163: Ham. Buzz, buzz!

Scene. - elsinore.
Act i. Scene i.
Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
Enter two sentinels-[first, ] francisco, [who paces up and down
at his post; then] bernardo, [who approaches him].
Ber. Who's there. ?
Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
Ber. Long live the king!
Fran. Bernardo?
Ber. He.
Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
Ber. 'tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, francisco.
Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'tis bitter cold,
and i am sick at heart.
Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
Ber. Well, good night.
If you do meet horatio and marcellus,
the rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
Enter horatio and marcellus.
Fran. I think i hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
Hor. Friends to this ground.
Mar. And liegemen to the dane.
Fran. Give you good night.
Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
Who hath reliev'd you?
Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
Give you good night. Exit.
Mar. Holla, bernardo!
Ber. Say-
what, is horatio there ?
Hor. A piece of him.
Ber. Welcome, horatio. Welcome, good marcellus.
Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
Ber. I have seen nothing.
Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
and will not let belief take hold of him
touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
Therefore i have entreated him along,
with us to watch the minutes of this night,
that, if again this apparition come,
he may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Ber. Sit down awhile,
and let us once again assail your ears,
that are so fortified against our story,
what we two nights have seen.
Hor. Well, sit we down,
and let us hear bernardo speak of this.
Ber. Last night of all,
when yond same star that's westward from the pole
had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
where now it burns, marcellus and myself,
the bell then beating one-
enter ghost.
Mar. Peace! Break thee off! Look where it comes again!
Ber. In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, horatio.
Ber. Looks it not like the king? Mark it, horatio.
Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Ber. It would be spoke to.
Mar. Question it, horatio.
Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
together with that fair and warlike form
in which the majesty of buried denmark
did sometimes march? By heaven i charge thee speak!
Mar. It is offended.
Ber. See, it stalks away!
Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
Exit ghost.
Mar. 'tis gone and will not answer.
Ber. How now, horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
Hor. Before my god, i might not this believe
without the sensible and true avouch
of mine own eyes.
Mar. Is it not like the king?
Hor. As thou art to thyself.
Such was the very armour he had on
when he th' ambitious norway combated.
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
he smote the sledded polacks on the ice.
'tis strange.
Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
Hor. In what particular thought to work i know not;
but, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
this bodes some strange eruption to our state.
Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
why this same strict and most observant watch
so nightly toils the subject of the land,
and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
and foreign mart for implements of war;
why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
does not divide the sunday from the week.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
Who is't that can inform me?
Hor. That can i.
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
whose image even but now appear'd to us,
was, as you know, by fortinbras of norway,
thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant hamlet
(for so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
did slay this fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
well ratified by law and heraldry,
did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
against the which a moiety competent
was gaged by our king; which had return'd
to the inheritance of fortinbras,
had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
and carriage of the article design'd,
his fell to hamlet. Now, sir, young fortinbras,
of unimproved mettle hot and full,
hath in the skirts of norway, here and there,
shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
for food and diet, to some enterprise
that hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
as it doth well appear unto our state,
but to recover of us, by strong hand
and terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
so by his father lost; and this, i take it,
is the main motive of our preparations,
the source of this our watch, and the chief head
of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
comes armed through our watch, so like the king
that was and is the question of these wars.
Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of rome,
a little ere the mightiest julius fell,
the graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber in the roman streets;
as stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
disasters in the sun; and the moist star
upon whose influence neptune's empire stands
was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
as harbingers preceding still the fates
and prologue to the omen coming on,
have heaven and earth together demonstrated
unto our climature and countrymen.
Enter ghost again.
But soft! Behold! Lo, where it comes again!
I'll cross it, though it blast me. - stay illusion!
Spreads his arms.
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
speak to me.
If there be any good thing to be done,
that may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
speak to me.
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
which happily foreknowing may avoid,
o, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
extorted treasure in the womb of earth
(for which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
the cock crows.
Speak of it! Stay, and speak! - stop it, marcellus!
Mar. Shall i strike at it with my partisan?
Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
Ber. 'tis here!
Hor. 'tis here!
Mar. 'tis gone!
Exit ghost.
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
to offer it the show of violence;
for it is as the air, invulnerable,
and our vain blows malicious mockery.
Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
upon a fearful summons. I have heard
the cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
awake the god of day; and at his warning,
whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
to his confine; and of the truth herein
this present object made probation.
Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
wherein our saviour's birth is celebrated,
the bird of dawning singeth all night long;
and then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
the nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
no fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
so hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
Hor. So have i heard and do in part believe it.
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
Break we our watch up; and by my advice
let us impart what we have seen to-night
unto young hamlet; for, upon my life,
this spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
as needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
Let's do't, i pray; and i this morning know
where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt.
Scene ii.
Elsinore. A room of state in the castle.
Flourish. [enter claudius, king of denmark, gertrude the queen, hamlet,
polonius, laertes and his sister ophelia, [voltemand, cornelius, ]
lords attendant.
King. Though yet of hamlet our dear brother's death
the memory be green, and that it us befitted
to bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
to be contracted in one brow of woe,
yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
that we with wisest sorrow think on him
together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
with an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
with mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
in equal scale weighing delight and dole,
taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
with this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young fortinbras,
holding a weak supposal of our worth,
or thinking by our late dear brother's death
our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
he hath not fail'd to pester us with message
importing the surrender of those lands
lost by his father, with all bands of law,
to our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
to norway, uncle of young fortinbras,
who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
his further gait herein, in that the levies,
the lists, and full proportions are all made
out of his subject; and we here dispatch
you, good cornelius, and you, voltemand,
for bearers of this greeting to old norway,
giving to you no further personal power
to business with the king, more than the scope
of these dilated articles allow. [gives a paper. ]
farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
Cor. , volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
Exeunt voltemand and cornelius.
And now, laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit. What is't, laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the dane
and lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, laertes,
that shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
the hand more instrumental to the mouth,
than is the throne of denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, laertes?
Laer. My dread lord,
your leave and favour to return to france;
from whence though willingly i came to denmark
to show my duty in your coronation,
yet now i must confess, that duty done,
my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france
and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
King. Have you your father's leave? What says polonius?
Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
by laboursome petition, and at last
upon his will i seal'd my hard consent.
I do beseech you give him leave to go.
King. Take thy fair hour, laertes. Time be thine,
and thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin hamlet, and my son-
ham. [aside] a little more than kin, and less than kind!
King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
Queen. Good hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
seek for thy noble father in the dust.
Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
passing through nature to eternity.
Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
Queen. If it be,
why seems it so particular with thee?
Ham. Seems, madam, nay, it is. I know not 'seems. '
'tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
nor customary suits of solemn black,
nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
no, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
nor the dejected havior of the visage,
together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
'that can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
for they are actions that a man might play;
but i have that within which passeth show-
these but the trappings and the suits of woe.
King. 'tis sweet and commendable in your nature, hamlet,
to give these mourning duties to your father;
but you must know, your father lost a father;
that father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
in filial obligation for some term
to do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
in obstinate condolement is a course
of impious stubbornness. 'tis unmanly grief;
it shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
a heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
an understanding simple and unschool'd;
for what we know must be, and is as common
as any the most vulgar thing to sense,
why should we in our peevish opposition
take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
a fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
to reason most absurd, whose common theme
is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
from the first corse till he that died to-day,
'this must be so. ' we pray you throw to earth
this unprevailing woe, and think of us
as of a father; for let the world take note
you are the most immediate to our throne,
and with no less nobility of love
than that which dearest father bears his son
do i impart toward you. For your intent
in going back to school in wittenberg,
it is most retrograde to our desire;
and we beseech you, bend you to remain
here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, hamlet.
I pray thee stay with us, go not to wittenberg.
Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
Be as ourself in denmark. Madam, come.
This gentle and unforc'd accord of hamlet
sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
no jocund health that denmark drinks to-day
but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
and the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Flourish. Exeunt all but hamlet.
Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the everlasting had not fix'd
his canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O god! God!
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! Ah, fie! 'tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
So excellent a king, that was to this
hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
that he might not beteem the winds of heaven
visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must i remember? Why, she would hang on him
as if increase of appetite had grown
by what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman! -
a little month, or ere those shoes were old
with which she followed my poor father's body
like niobe, all tears- why she, even she
(o god! A beast that wants discourse of reason
would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
my father's brother, but no more like my father
than i to hercules. Within a month,
ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
she married. O, most wicked speed, to post
with such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
But break my heart, for i must hold my tongue!
Enter horatio, marcellus, and bernardo.
Hor. Hail to your lordship!
Ham. I am glad to see you well.
Horatio! - or i do forget myself.
Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Ham. Sir, my good friend- i'll change that name with you.
And what make you from wittenberg, horatio?
Marcellus?
Mar. My good lord!
Ham. I am very glad to see you. - [to bernardo] good even, sir. -
but what, in faith, make you from wittenberg?
Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
nor shall you do my ear that violence
to make it truster of your own report
against yourself. I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Hor. My lord, i came to see your father's funeral.
Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
Ham. Thrift, thrift, horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would i had met my dearest foe in heaven
or ever i had seen that day, horatio!
My father- methinks i see my father.
Hor. O, where, my lord?
Ham. In my mind's eye, horatio.
Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
I shall not look upon his like again.
Hor. My lord, i think i saw him yesternight.
Ham. Saw? Who?
Hor. My lord, the king your father.
Ham. The king my father?
Hor. Season your admiration for a while
with an attent ear, till i may deliver
upon the witness of these gentlemen,
this marvel to you.
Ham. For god's love let me hear!
Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
(marcellus and bernardo) on their watch
in the dead vast and middle of the night
been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
appears before them and with solemn march
goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
by their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
almost to jelly with the act of fear,
stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
in dreadful secrecy impart they did,
and i with them the third night kept the watch;
where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
form of the thing, each word made true and good,
the apparition comes. I knew your father.
These hands are not more like.
Ham. But where was this?
Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Ham. Did you not speak to it?
Hor. My lord, i did;
but answer made it none. Yet once methought
it lifted up it head and did address
itself to motion, like as it would speak;
but even then the morning cock crew loud,
and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
and vanish'd from our sight.
Ham. 'tis very strange.
Hor. As i do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
and we did think it writ down in our duty
to let you know of it.
Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?
Both [mar. And ber. ] we do, my lord.
Ham. Arm'd, say you?
Both. Arm'd, my lord.
Ham. From top to toe?
Both. My lord, from head to foot.
Ham. Then saw you not his face?
Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Ham. Pale or red?
Hor. Nay, very pale.
Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Hor. Most constantly.
Ham. I would i had been there.
Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Both. Longer, longer.
Hor. Not when i saw't.
Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
Hor. It was, as i have seen it in his life,
a sable silver'd.
Ham. I will watch to-night.
Perchance 'twill walk again.
Hor. I warr'nt it will.
Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
i'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
and bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
if you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
let it be tenable in your silence still;
and whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
give it an understanding but no tongue.
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
i'll visit you.
All. Our duty to your honour.
Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
Exeunt [all but hamlet].
My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.
Scene iii.
Elsinore. A room in the house of polonius.
Enter laertes and ophelia.
Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
and convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
but let me hear from you.
Oph. Do you doubt that?
Laer. For hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
a violet in the youth of primy nature,
forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
the perfume and suppliance of a minute;
no more.
Oph. No more but so?
Laer. Think it no more.
For nature crescent does not grow alone
in thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
the inward service of the mind and soul
grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
the virtue of his will; but you must fear,
his greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
for he himself is subject to his birth.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
carve for himself, for on his choice depends
the safety and health of this whole state,
and therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
unto the voice and yielding of that body
whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
it fits your wisdom so far to believe it
as he in his particular act and place
may give his saying deed; which is no further
than the main voice of denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
if with too credent ear you list his songs,
or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
to his unmast'red importunity.
Fear it, ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
and keep you in the rear of your affection,
out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
if she unmask her beauty to the moon.
Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
The canker galls the infants of the spring
too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
as watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
do not as some ungracious pastors do,
show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
and recks not his own rede.
Laer. O, fear me not!
Enter polonius.
I stay too long. But here my father comes.
A double blessing is a double grace;
occasion smiles upon a second leave.
Pol. Yet here, laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
and you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
but not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
for the apparel oft proclaims the man,
and they in france of the best rank and station
are most select and generous, chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
for loan oft loses both itself and friend,
and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all- to thine own self be true,
and it must follow, as the night the day,
thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
Laer. Most humbly do i take my leave, my lord.
Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
Laer. Farewell, ophelia, and remember well
what i have said to you.
Oph. 'tis in my memory lock'd,
and you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Laer. Farewell. Exit.
Pol. What is't, ophelia, he hath said to you?
Oph. So please you, something touching the lord hamlet.
Pol. Marry, well bethought!
'tis told me he hath very oft of late
given private time to you, and you yourself
have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
and that in way of caution- i must tell you
you do not understand yourself so clearly
as it behooves my daughter and your honour.
What is between you? Give me up the truth.
Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
of his affection to me.
Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
Oph. I do not know, my lord, what i should think,
pol. Marry, i will teach you! Think yourself a baby
that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
in honourable fashion.
Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
with almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
when the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
giving more light than heat, extinct in both
even in their promise, as it is a-making,
you must not take for fire. From this time
be something scanter of your maiden presence.
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
than a command to parley. For lord hamlet,
believe so much in him, that he is young,
and with a larger tether may he walk
than may be given you. In few, ophelia,
do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
not of that dye which their investments show,
but mere implorators of unholy suits,
breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
the better to beguile. This is for all:
i would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
have you so slander any moment leisure
as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet.
Look to't, i charge you. Come your ways.
Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
Exeunt.
Scene iv.
Elsinore. The platform before the castle.
Enter hamlet, horatio, and marcellus.
Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
Ham. What hour now?
Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
Mar. No, it is struck.
Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
What does this mean, my lord?
Ham. The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
and, as he drains his draughts of rhenish down,
the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
the triumph of his pledge.
Hor. Is it a custom?
Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
but to my mind, though i am native here
and to the manner born, it is a custom
more honour'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
they clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
soil our addition; and indeed it takes
from our achievements, though perform'd at height,
the pith and marrow of our attribute.
So oft it chances in particular men
that, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
as in their birth, - wherein they are not guilty,
since nature cannot choose his origin, -
by the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
the form of plausive manners, that these men
carrying, i say, the stamp of one defect,
being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
as infinite as man may undergo-
shall in the general censure take corruption
from that particular fault. The dram of e'il
doth all the noble substance often dout to his own scandal.
Enter ghost.
Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
be thy intents wicked or charitable,
thou com'st in such a questionable shape
that i will speak to thee. I'll call thee hamlet,
king, father, royal dane. O, answer me?
Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
to cast thee up again. What may this mean
that thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
making night hideous, and we fools of nature
so horridly to shake our disposition
with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?
Ghost beckons hamlet.
Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
as if it some impartment did desire
to you alone.
Mar. Look with what courteous action
it waves you to a more removed ground.
But do not go with it!
Hor. No, by no means!
Ham. It will not speak. Then will i follow it.
Hor. Do not, my lord!
Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
and for my soul, what can it do to that,
being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
that beetles o'er his base into the sea,
and there assume some other, horrible form
which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
and draw you into madness? Think of it.
The very place puts toys of desperation,
without more motive, into every brain
that looks so many fadoms to the sea
and hears it roar beneath.
Ham. It waves me still.
Go on. I'll follow thee.
Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
Ham. Hold off your hands!
Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
Ham. My fate cries out
and makes each petty artire in this body
as hardy as the nemean lion's nerve.
[ghost beckons. ]
still am i call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heaven, i'll make a ghost of him that lets me! -
i say, away! - go on. I'll follow thee.
Exeunt ghost and hamlet.
Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
Mar. Let's follow. 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
Mar. Something is rotten in the state of denmark.
Hor. Heaven will direct it.
Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
Exeunt.
Scene v.
Elsinore. The castle. Another part of the fortifications.
Enter ghost and hamlet.
Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
Ghost. Mark me.
Ham. I will.
Ghost. My hour is almost come,
when i to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
must render up myself.
Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
to what i shall unfold.
Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
Ham. What?
Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
and for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
are burnt and purg'd away. But that i am forbid
to tell the secrets of my prison house,
i could a tale unfold whose lightest word
would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
thy knotted and combined locks to part,
and each particular hair to stand an end
like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
But this eternal blazon must not be
to ears of flesh and blood. List, list, o, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
ham. O god!
Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
Ham. Murther?
Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
but this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
Ham. Haste me to know't, that i, with wings as swift
as meditation or the thoughts of love,
may sweep to my revenge.
Ghost. I find thee apt;
and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf,
wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, hamlet, hear.
'tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
a serpent stung me. So the whole ear of denmark
is by a forged process of my death
rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
the serpent that did sting thy father's life
now wears his crown.
Ham. O my prophetic soul!
My uncle?
Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
with witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
o wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
so to seduce! - won to his shameful lust
the will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
O hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
from me, whose love was of that dignity
that it went hand in hand even with the vow
i made to her in marriage, and to decline
upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
to those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
so lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
will sate itself in a celestial bed
and prey on garbage.
But soft! Methinks i scent the morning air.
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
my custom always of the afternoon,
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
with juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
and in the porches of my ears did pour
the leperous distilment; whose effect
holds such an enmity with blood of man
that swift as quicksilverr it courses through
the natural gates and alleys of the body,
and with a sudden vigour it doth posset
and curd, like eager droppings into milk,
the thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
and a most instant tetter bark'd about,
most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
all my smooth body.
Thus was i, sleeping, by a brother's hand
of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
no reckoning made, but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head.
Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! Most horrible!
Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Let not the royal bed of denmark be
a couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
to prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
and gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. Exit.
Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
And shall i couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
but bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
in this distracted globe. Remember thee?
Yea, from the table of my memory
i'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
all saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
that youth and observation copied there,
and thy commandment all alone shall live
within the book and volume of my brain,
unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables! Meet it is i set it down
that one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
at least i am sure it may be so in denmark. [writes. ]
so, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
it is 'adieu, adieu! Remember me. '
i have sworn't.
Hor. (within) my lord, my lord!
Enter horatio and marcellus.
Mar. Lord hamlet!
Hor. Heaven secure him!
Ham. So be it!
Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
Hor. What news, my lord?
Mar. O, wonderful!
Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
Ham. No, you will reveal it.
Hor. Not i, my lord, by heaven!
Mar. Nor i, my lord.
Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?
Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all denmark
but he's an arrant knave.
Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
to tell us this.
Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
And so, without more circumstance at all,
i hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
you, as your business and desires shall point you,
for every man hath business and desire,
such as it is; and for my own poor part,
look you, i'll go pray.
Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
yes, faith, heartily.
Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
Ham. Yes, by saint patrick, but there is, horatio,
and much offence too. Touching this vision here,
it is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
For your desire to know what is between us,
o'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
as you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
give me one poor request.
Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
Both. My lord, we will not.
Ham. Nay, but swear't.
Hor. In faith,
my lord, not i.
Mar. Nor i, my lord- in faith.
Ham. Upon my sword.
Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Ghost cries under the stage.
Ghost. Swear.
Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
Consent to swear.
Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Swear by my sword.
Ghost. [beneath] swear.
Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen,
and lay your hands again upon my sword.
Never to speak of this that you have heard:
swear by my sword.
Ghost. [beneath] swear by his sword.
Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends. "
hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, horatio,
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
But come!
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
how strange or odd soe'er i bear myself
(as i perchance hereafter shall think meet
to put an antic disposition on),
that you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
with arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
as 'well, well, we know, ' or 'we could, an if we would, '
or 'if we list to speak, ' or 'there be, an if they might, '
or such ambiguous giving out, to note
that you know aught of me- this is not to do,
so grace and mercy at your most need help you,
swear.
Ghost. [beneath] swear.
[they swear. ]
ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
with all my love i do commend me to you;
and what so poor a man as hamlet is
may do t' express his love and friending to you,
god willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
and still your fingers on your lips, i pray.
The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
that ever i was born to set it right!
Nay, come, let's go together.
Exeunt.
Act ii. Scene i.
Elsinore. A room in the house of polonius.
Enter polonius and reynaldo.
Pol. Give him this money and these notes, reynaldo.
Rey. I will, my lord.
Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good reynaldo,
before you visit him, to make inquire
of his behaviour.
Rey. My lord, i did intend it.
Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
enquire me first what danskers are in paris;
and how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
what company, at what expense; and finding
by this encompassment and drift of question
that they do know my son, come you more nearer
than your particular demands will touch it.
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
as thus, 'i know his father and his friends,
and in part him. ' do you mark this, reynaldo?
Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
Pol. 'and in part him, but, ' you may say, 'not well.
But if't be he i mean, he's very wild
addicted so and so'; and there put on him
what forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
as may dishonour him- take heed of that;
but, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
as are companions noted and most known
to youth and liberty.
Rey. As gaming, my lord.
Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
drabbing. You may go so far.
Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
You must not put another scandal on him,
that he is open to incontinency.
That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
that they may seem the taints of liberty,
the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
a savageness in unreclaimed blood,
of general assault.
Rey. But, my good lord-
pol. Wherefore should you do this?
Rey. Ay, my lord,
i would know that.
Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
and i believe it is a fetch of warrant.
You laying these slight sullies on my son
as 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
mark you,
your party in converse, him you would sound,
having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
the youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
he closes with you in this consequence:
'good sir, ' or so, or 'friend, ' or 'gentleman'-
according to the phrase or the addition
of man and country-
rey. Very good, my lord.
Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- what was i about to say?
By the mass, i was about to say something! Where did i leave?
Rey. At 'closes in the consequence, ' at 'friend or so, ' and
gentleman. '
pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- ay, marry!
He closes thus: 'i know the gentleman.
I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
there was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
there falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
'i saw him enter such a house of sale, '
videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now-
your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
and thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
with windlasses and with assays of bias,
by indirections find directions out.
So, by my former lecture and advice,
shall you my son. You have me, have you not
rey. My lord, i have.
Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
Rey. Good my lord! [going. ]
pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
Rey. I shall, my lord.
Pol. And let him ply his music.
Rey. Well, my lord.
Pol. Farewell!
Exit reynaldo.
Enter ophelia.
How now, ophelia? What's the matter?
Oph. O my lord, my lord, i have been so affrighted!
Pol. With what, i' th' name of god i
oph. My lord, as i was sewing in my closet,
lord hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
no hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
and with a look so piteous in purport
as if he had been loosed out of hell
to speak of horrors- he comes before me.
Pol. Mad for thy love?
Oph. My lord, i do not know,
but truly i do fear it.
Pol. What said he?
Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
then goes he to the length of all his arm,
and, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
he falls to such perusal of my face
as he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
and thrice his head thus waving up and down,
he rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
as it did seem to shatter all his bulk
and end his being. That done, he lets me go,
and with his head over his shoulder turn'd
he seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
for out o' doors he went without their help
and to the last bended their light on me.
Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the king.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
whose violent property fordoes itself
and leads the will to desperate undertakings
as oft as any passion under heaven
that does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
i did repel his letters and denied
his access to me.
Pol. That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
i had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
and meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
as it is common for the younger sort
to lack discretion. Come, go we to the king.
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
more grief to hide than hate to utter love.
Come.
Exeunt.
Scene ii.
Elsinore. A room in the castle.
Flourish. [enter king and queen, rosencrantz and guildenstern, cum aliis.
King. Welcome, dear rosencrantz and guildenstern.
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
the need we have to use you did provoke
our hasty sending. Something have you heard
of hamlet's transformation. So i call it,
sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
resembles that it was. What it should be,
more than his father's death, that thus hath put him
so much from th' understanding of himself,
i cannot dream of. I entreat you both
that, being of so young clays brought up with him,
and since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
some little time; so by your companies
to draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
so much as from occasion you may glean,
whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
that, open'd, lies within our remedy.
Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
and sure i am two men there are not living
to whom he more adheres. If it will please you
to show us so much gentry and good will
as to expend your time with us awhile
for the supply and profit of our hope,
your visitation shall receive such thanks
as fits a king's remembrance.
Ros. Both your majesties
might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
put your dread pleasures more into command
than to entreaty.
Guil. But we both obey,
and here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
to lay our service freely at your feet,
to be commanded.
King. Thanks, rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern.
Queen. Thanks, guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz.
And i beseech you instantly to visit
my too much changed son. - go, some of you,
and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is.
Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
pleasant and helpful to him!
Queen. Ay, amen!
Exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern, [with some
attendants].
Enter polonius.
Pol. Th' ambassadors from norway, my good lord,
are joyfully return'd.
King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Pol. Have i, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
i hold my duty as i hold my soul,
both to my god and to my gracious king;
and i do think- or else this brain of mine
hunts not the trail of policy so sure
as it hath us'd to do- that i have found
the very cause of hamlet's lunacy.
King. O, speak of that! That do i long to hear.
Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
[exit polonius. ]
he tells me, my dear gertrude, he hath found
the head and source of all your son's distemper.
Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
his father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
King. Well, we shall sift him.
Enter polonius, voltemand, and cornelius.
Welcome, my good friends.
Say, voltemand, what from our brother norway?
Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
his nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
to be a preparation 'gainst the polack,
but better look'd into, he truly found
it was against your highness; whereat griev'd,
that so his sickness, age, and impotence
was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
on fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
receives rebuke from norway, and, in fine,
makes vow before his uncle never more
to give th' assay of arms against your majesty.
Whereon old norway, overcome with joy,
gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
and his commission to employ those soldiers,
so levied as before, against the polack;
with an entreaty, herein further shown,
[gives a paper. ]
that it might please you to give quiet pass
through your dominions for this enterprise,
on such regards of safety and allowance
as therein are set down.
King. It likes us well;
and at our more consider'd time we'll read,
answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
Most welcome home! Exeunt ambassadors.
Pol. This business is well ended.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
what majesty should be, what duty is,
why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
i will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
Mad call i it; for, to define true madness,
what is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.
Queen. More matter, with less art.
Pol. Madam, i swear i use no art at all.
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
and pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
But farewell it, for i will use no art.
Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
that we find out the cause of this effect-
or rather say, the cause of this defect,
for this effect defective comes by cause.
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Perpend.
I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
who in her duty and obedience, mark,
hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
[reads] the letter.
'to the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
ophelia, '-
that's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
phrase.
But you shall hear. Thus:
[reads. ]
'in her excellent white bosom, these, &c. '
queen. Came this from hamlet to her?
Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful. [reads. ]
'doubt thou the stars are fire;
doubt that the sun doth move;
doubt truth to be a liar;
but never doubt i love.
'o dear ophelia, i am ill at these numbers; i have not art to
reckon my groans; but that i love thee best, o most best, believe
it. Adieu.
'thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
hamlet. '
this, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
and more above, hath his solicitings,
as they fell out by time, by means, and place,
all given to mine ear.
King. But how hath she
receiv'd his love?
Pol. What do you think of me?
King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
when i had seen this hot love on the wing
(as i perceiv'd it, i must tell you that,
before my daughter told me), what might you,
or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
if i had play'd the desk or table book,
or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
What might you think? No, i went round to work
and my young mistress thus i did bespeak:
'lord hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
This must not be. ' and then i prescripts gave her,
that she should lock herself from his resort,
admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
and he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
into the madness wherein now he raves,
and all we mourn for.
King. Do you think 'tis this?
Queen. It may be, very like.
Pol. Hath there been such a time- i would fain know that-
that i have positively said ''tis so, '
when it prov'd otherwise. ?
King. Not that i know.
Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] take this from this, if this
be otherwise.
If circumstances lead me, i will find
where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
within the centre.
King. How may we try it further?
Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
here in the lobby.
Queen. So he does indeed.
Pol. At such a time i'll loose my daughter to him.
Be you and i behind an arras then.
Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
and he not from his reason fall'n thereon
let me be no assistant for a state,
but keep a farm and carters.
King. We will try it.
Enter hamlet, reading on a book.
Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
Pol. Away, i do beseech you, both away
i'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
Exeunt king and queen, [with attendants].
How does my good lord hamlet?
Ham. Well, god-a-mercy.
Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
Pol. Not i, my lord.
Ham. Then i would you were so honest a man.
Pol. Honest, my lord?
Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
pick'd out of ten thousand.
Pol. That's very true, my lord.
Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
kissing carrion- have you a daughter?
Pol. I have, my lord.
Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
Pol. [aside] how say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
he knew me not at first. He said i was a fishmonger. He is far
gone, far gone! And truly in my youth i suff'red much extremity
for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again. - what do you
read, my lord?
Ham. Words, words, words.
Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
Ham. Between who?
Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
sir, though i most powerfully and potently believe, yet i hold it
not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
should be old as i am if, like a crab, you could go backward.
Pol. [aside] though this be madness, yet there is a method in't. -
will you walk out of the air, my lord?
Ham. Into my grave?
Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [aside] how pregnant sometimes
his replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on, which
reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
him and my daughter. - my honourable lord, i will most humbly take
my leave of you.
Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that i will more
willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
life,
enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.
Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
Ham. These tedious old fools!
Pol. You go to seek the lord hamlet. There he is.
Ros. [to polonius] god save you, sir!
Exit [polonius].
Guil. My honour'd lord!
Ros. My most dear lord!
Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, guildenstern? Ah,
rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
Ros. Neither, my lord.
Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
favours?
Guil. Faith, her privates we.
Ham. In the secret parts of fortune? O! Most true! She is a
strumpet. What news ?
Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison
hither?
Guil. Prison, my lord?
Ham. Denmark's a prison.
Ros. Then is the world one.
Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
dungeons, denmark being one o' th' worst.
Ros. We think not so, my lord.
Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'tis too narrow for your
mind.
Ham. O god, i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
king of infinite space, were it not that i have bad dreams.
Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
Ros. Truly, and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
it is but a shadow's shadow.
Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? For, by my
fay, i cannot reason.
Both. We'll wait upon you.
Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, i am most
dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
make you at elsinore?
Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
Ham. Beggar that i am, i am even poor in thanks; but i thank you;
and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.
Guil. What should we say, my lord?
Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour. I know the good king and queen
have sent for you.
Ros. To what end, my lord?
Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
me, whether you were sent for or no.
Ros. [aside to guildenstern] what say you?
Ham. [aside] nay then, i have an eye of you. - if you love me, hold
not off.
Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
feather. I have of late- but wherefore i know not- lost all my
mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! How infinite in
faculties! In form and moving how express and admirable! In
action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a god! The
beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman
neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
Ham. Why did you laugh then, when i said 'man delights not me'?
Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his majesty shall
have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
they?
Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
tragedians of the city.
Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
reputation and profit, was better both ways.
Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
innovation.
Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the
city? Are they so follow'd?
Ros. No indeed are they not.
Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
dare scarce come thither.
Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means
are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
against their own succession.
Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
went to cuffs in the question.
Ham. Is't possible?
Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Ham. Do the boys carry it away?
Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- hercules and his load too.
Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of denmark, and
those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
little. 'sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
philosophy could find it out.
Flourish for the players.
Guil. There are the players.
Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which i
tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
Guil. In what, my dear lord?
Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly i
know a hawk from a handsaw.
Enter polonius.
Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
Ham. Hark you, guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
clouts.
Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
man is twice a child.
Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it. -
you say right, sir; a monday morning; twas so indeed.
Pol. My lord, i have news to tell you.
Ham. My lord, i have news to tell you. When roscius was an actor in
rome-
pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
Ham. Buzz, buzz!
Pol. Upon my honour-
ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene
individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
the only men.
Ham. O jephthah, judge of israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
Ham. Why,
'one fair daughter, and no more,
the which he loved passing well. '
pol. [aside] still on my daughter.
Ham. Am i not i' th' right, old jephthah?
Pol. If you call me jephthah, my lord, i have a daughter that i
love passing well.
Ham. Nay, that follows not.
Pol. What follows then, my lord?
Ham. Why,
'as by lot, god wot, '
and then, you know,
'it came to pass, as most like it was. '
the first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
where my abridgment comes.
Enter four or five players.
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. - i am glad to see thee
well. - welcome, good friends. - o, my old friend? Why, thy face is
valanc'd since i saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
denmark? - what, my young lady and mistress? By'r lady, your
ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray god your voice, like a piece of
uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring. - masters, you are
all welcome. We'll e'en to't like french falconers, fly at
anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
or if it was, not above once; for the play, i remember, pleas'd
not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as i
receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't
i chiefly lov'd. 'twas aeneas' tale to dido, and thereabout of it
especially where he speaks of priam's slaughter. If it live in
your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:
'the rugged pyrrhus, like th' hyrcanian beast-'
'tis not so; it begins with pyrrhus:
'the rugged pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
black as his purpose, did the night resemble
when he lay couched in the ominous horse,
hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
with heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
with blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
that lend a tyrannous and a damned light
to their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
and thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
with eyes like carbuncles, the hellish pyrrhus
old grandsire priam seeks. '
so, proceed you.
Pol. Fore god, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
discretion.
1. Play. 'anon he finds him,
striking too short at greeks. His antique sword,
rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
pyrrhus at priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless ilium,
seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
takes prisoner pyrrhus' ear. For lo! His sword,
which was declining on the milky head
of reverend priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
So, as a painted tyrant, pyrrhus stood,
and, like a neutral to his will and matter,
did nothing.
But, as we often see, against some storm,
a silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
the bold winds speechless, and the orb below
as hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
doth rend the region; so, after pyrrhus' pause,
aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
and never did the cyclops' hammers fall
on mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
with less remorse than pyrrhus' bleeding sword
now falls on priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet fortune! All you gods,
in general synod take away her power;
break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
as low as to the fiends!
Pol. This is too long.
Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard. - prithee say on.
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
hecuba.
1. Play. 'but who, o who, had seen the mobled queen-'
ham. 'the mobled queen'?
Pol. That's good! 'mobled queen' is good.
1. Play. 'run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
with bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
about her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
a blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-
who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
'gainst fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
But if the gods themselves did see her then,
when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport
in mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
the instant burst of clamour that she made
(unless things mortal move them not at all)
would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
and passion in the gods. '
pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
eyes. Prithee no more!
Ham. 'tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon. -
good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
Pol. My lord, i will use them according to their desert.
Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own
honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in
your bounty. Take them in.
Pol. Come, sirs.
Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
Exeunt polonius and players [except the first].
Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'the murther of
gonzago'?
1. Play. Ay, my lord.
Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and
insert in't, could you not?
1. Play. Ay, my lord.
Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
[exit first player. ]
my good friends, i'll leave you till night. You are welcome to
elsinore.
Ros. Good my lord!
Ham. Ay, so, god b' wi' ye!
[exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
now i am alone.
O what a rogue and peasant slave am i!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
but in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
could force his soul so to his own conceit
that, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
a broken voice, and his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
For hecuba!
What's hecuba to him, or he to hecuba,
that he should weep for her? What would he do,
had he the motive and the cue for passion
that i have? He would drown the stage with tears
and cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
make mad the guilty and appal the free,
confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
the very faculties of eyes and ears.
Yet i,
a dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
like john-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
and can say nothing! No, not for a king,
upon whose property and most dear life
a damn'd defeat was made. Am i a coward?
Who calls me villain? Breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by th' nose? Gives me the lie i' th' throat
as deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
'swounds, i should take it! For it cannot be
but i am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
to make oppression bitter, or ere this
i should have fatted all the region kites
with this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am i! This is most brave,
that i, the son of a dear father murther'd,
prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
and fall a-cursing like a very drab,
a scullion!
Fie upon't! Foh! About, my brain! Hum, i have heard
that guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul that presently
they have proclaim'd their malefactions;
for murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
with most miraculous organ, i'll have these players
play something like the murther of my father
before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
i'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
i know my course. The spirit that i have seen
may be a devil; and the devil hath power
t' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
out of my weakness and my melancholy,
as he is very potent with such spirits,
abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
more relative than this. The play's the thing
wherein i'll catch the conscience of the king. Exit.
Act iii. Scene i.
Elsinore. A room in the castle.
Enter king, queen, polonius, ophelia, rosencrantz, guildenstern, and lords.
King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
get from him why he puts on this confusion,
grating so harshly all his days of quiet
with turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
but from what cause he will by no means speak.
Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
but with a crafty madness keeps aloof
when we would bring him on to some confession
of his true state.
Queen. Did he receive you well?
Ros. Most like a gentleman.
Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
most free in his reply.
Queen. Did you assay him
to any pastime?
Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
we o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
and there did seem in him a kind of joy
to hear of it. They are here about the court,
and, as i think, they have already order
this night to play before him.
Pol. 'tis most true;
and he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
to hear and see the matter.
King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
to hear him so inclin'd.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
and drive his purpose on to these delights.
Ros. We shall, my lord.
Exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern.
King. Sweet gertrude, leave us too;
for we have closely sent for hamlet hither,
that he, as 'twere by accident, may here
affront ophelia.
Her father and myself (lawful espials)
will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
we may of their encounter frankly judge
and gather by him, as he is behav'd,
if't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
that thus he suffers for.
Queen. I shall obey you;
and for your part, ophelia, i do wish
that your good beauties be the happy cause
of hamlet's wildness. So shall i hope your virtues
will bring him to his wonted way again,
to both your honours.
Oph. Madam, i wish it may.
[exit queen. ]
pol. Ophelia, walk you here. - gracious, so please you,
we will bestow ourselves. - [to ophelia] read on this book,
that show of such an exercise may colour
your loneliness. - we are oft to blame in this,
'tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
and pious action we do sugar o'er
the devil himself.
King. [aside] o, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
than is my deed to my most painted word.
O heavy burthen!
Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
Exeunt king and polonius].
Enter hamlet.
Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
and by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
no more; and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to. 'tis a consummation
devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
must give us pause. There's the respect
that makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
the pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
the insolence of office, and the spurns
that patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
when he himself might his quietus make
with a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
to grunt and sweat under a weary life,
but that the dread of something after death-
the undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
no traveller returns- puzzles the will,
and makes us rather bear those ills we have
than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
and thus the native hue of resolution
is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
and enterprises of great pith and moment
with this regard their currents turn awry
and lose the name of action. - soft you now!
The fair ophelia! - nymph, in thy orisons
be all my sins rememb'red.
Oph. Good my lord,
how does your honour for this many a day?
Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
Oph. My lord, i have remembrances of yours
that i have longed long to re-deliver.
I pray you, now receive them.
Ham. No, not i!
I never gave you aught.
Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
and with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
as made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
take these again; for to the noble mind
rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
Oph. My lord?
Ham. Are you fair?
Oph. What means your lordship?
Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty.
Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
not.
Oph. I was the more deceived.
Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet i could accuse
me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
beck than i have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as i
do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
father?
Oph. At home, my lord.
Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
Ham. If thou dost marry, i'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
Farewell.
Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
amble, and you lisp; you nickname god's creatures and make your
wantonness your ignorance. Go to, i'll no more on't! It hath made
me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
they are. To a nunnery, go. Exit.
Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
the glass of fashion and the mould of form,
th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
And i, of ladies most deject and wretched,
that suck'd the honey of his music vows,
now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
that unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
t' have seen what i have seen, see what i see!
Enter king and polonius.
King. Love? His affections do not that way tend;
nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
was not like madness. There's something in his soul
o'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose
will be some danger; which for to prevent,
i have in quick determination
thus set it down: he shall with speed to england
for the demand of our neglected tribute.
Haply the seas, and countries different,
with variable objects, shall expel
this something-settled matter in his heart,
whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
from fashion of himself. What think you on't?
Pol. It shall do well. But yet do i believe
the origin and commencement of his grief
sprung from neglected love. - how now, ophelia?
You need not tell us what lord hamlet said.
We heard it all. - my lord, do as you please;
but if you hold it fit, after the play
let his queen mother all alone entreat him
to show his grief. Let her be round with him;
and i'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
of all their conference. If she find him not,
to england send him; or confine him where
your wisdom best shall think.
King. It shall be so.
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Exeunt.
Scene ii.
Elsinore. Hall in the castle.
Enter hamlet and three of the players.
Ham. Speak the speech, i pray you, as i pronounc'd it to you,
trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
players do, i had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as i may say)
whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
(for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
termagant. It out-herods herod. Pray you avoid it.
Player. I warrant your honour.
Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that i
have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
christians, nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature's
journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
humanity so abominably.
Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous
and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
make you ready.
Exeunt players.
Enter polonius, rosencrantz, and guildenstern.
How now, my lord? Will the king hear this piece of work?
Pol. And the queen too, and that presently.
Ham. Bid the players make haste, [exit polonius. ] will you two
help to hasten them?
Both. We will, my lord. Exeunt they two.
Ham. What, ho, horatio!
Enter horatio.
Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
as e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
Hor. O, my dear lord!
Ham. Nay, do not think i flatter;
for what advancement may i hope from thee,
that no revenue hast but thy good spirits
to feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
and could of men distinguish, her election
hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been
as one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
a man that fortune's buffets and rewards
hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
that they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
to sound what stop she please. Give me that man
that is not passion's slave, and i will wear him
in my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
as i do thee. Something too much of this i
there is a play to-night before the king.
One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
which i have told thee, of my father's death.
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
even with the very comment of thy soul
observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
do not itself unkennel in one speech,
it is a damned ghost that we have seen,
and my imaginations are as foul
as vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
for i mine eyes will rivet to his face,
and after we will both our judgments join
in censure of his seeming.
Hor. Well, my lord.
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
and scape detecting, i will pay the theft.
Sound a flourish. [enter trumpets and kettledrums. Danish
march. [enter king, queen, polonius, ophelia, rosencrantz,
guildenstern, and other lords attendant, with the guard
carrying torches.
Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
Get you a place.
King. How fares our cousin hamlet?
Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
King. I have nothing with this answer, hamlet. These words are not
mine.
Ham. No, nor mine now. [to polonius] my lord, you play'd once
i' th' university, you say?
Pol. That did i, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
Ham. What did you enact?
Pol. I did enact julius caesar; i was kill'd i' th' capitol; brutus
kill'd me.
Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
the players ready.
Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
Queen. Come hither, my dear hamlet, sit by me.
Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
Pol. [to the king] o, ho! Do you mark that?
Ham. Lady, shall i lie in your lap?
[sits down at ophelia's feet. ]
oph. No, my lord.
Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
Oph. Ay, my lord.
Ham. Do you think i meant country matters?
Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
Oph. What is, my lord?
Ham. Nothing.
Oph. You are merry, my lord.
Ham. Who, i?
Oph. Ay, my lord.
Ham. O god, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
within 's two hours.
Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for i'll have a
suit of sables. O heavens! Die two months ago, and not forgotten
yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
half a year. But, by'r lady, he must build churches then; or else
shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose
epitaph is 'for o, for o, the hobby-horse is forgot! '
hautboys play. The dumb show enters.
Enter a king and a queen very lovingly; the queen embracing
him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
leaves him. The queen returns, finds the king dead, and makes
passionate action. The poisoner with some three or four mutes,
comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
carried away. The poisoner wooes the queen with gifts; she
seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
his love.
Exeunt.
Oph. What means this, my lord?
Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
Enter prologue.
Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
they'll tell all.
Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
here stooping to your clemency,
we beg your hearing patiently. [exit. ]
ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
Oph. 'tis brief, my lord.
Ham. As woman's love.
Enter [two players as] king and queen.
King. Full thirty times hath phoebus' cart gone round
neptune's salt wash and tellus' orbed ground,
and thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
about the world have times twelve thirties been,
since love our hearts, and hymen did our hands,
unite comutual in most sacred bands.
Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
make us again count o'er ere love be done!
But woe is me! You are so sick of late,
so far from cheer and from your former state.
That i distrust you. Yet, though i distrust,
discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
for women's fear and love holds quantity,
in neither aught, or in extremity.
Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
and as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
King. Faith, i must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
my operant powers their functions leave to do.
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
for husband shalt thou-
queen. O, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
When second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who killed the first.
Ham. [aside] wormwood, wormwood!
Queen. The instances that second marriage move
are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
A second time i kill my husband dead
when second husband kisses me in bed.
King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
but what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
of violent birth, but poor validity;
which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
but fill unshaken when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
the passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
their own enactures with themselves destroy.
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
that even our loves should with our fortunes change;
for 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
the poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
and hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
for who not needs shall never lack a friend,
and who in want a hollow friend doth try,
directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where i begun,
our wills and fates do so contrary run
that our devices still are overthrown;
our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
sport and repose lock from me day and night,
to desperation turn my trust and hope,
an anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
each opposite that blanks the face of joy
meet what i would have well, and it destroy,
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
if, once a widow, ever i be wife!
Ham. If she should break it now!
King. 'tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
My spirits grow dull, and fain i would beguile
the tedious day with sleep.
Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
[he] sleeps.
And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit.
Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
world.
King. What do you call the play?
Ham. 'the mousetrap. ' marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
image of a murther done in vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;
his wife, baptista. You shall see anon. 'tis a knavish piece of
work; but what o' that? Your majesty, and we that have free
souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our withers
are unwrung.
Enter lucianus.
This is one lucianus, nephew to the king.
Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if i could see
the puppets dallying.
Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
Oph. Still better, and worse.
Ham. So you must take your husbands. - begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
bellow for revenge.
Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
confederate season, else no creature seeing;
thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
with hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
thy natural magic and dire property
on wholesome life usurp immediately.
Pours the poison in his ears.
Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's gonzago.
The story is extant, and written in very choice italian. You
shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of gonzago's wife.
Oph. The king rises.
Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
Queen. How fares my lord?
Pol. Give o'er the play.
King. Give me some light! Away!
All. Lights, lights, lights!
Exeunt all but hamlet and horatio.
Ham. Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
the hart ungalled play;
for some must watch, while some must sleep:
thus runs the world away.
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my
fortunes turn turk with me-with two provincial roses on my raz'd
shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
Hor. Half a share.
Ham. A whole one i!
For thou dost know, o damon dear,
this realm dismantled was
of jove himself; and now reigns here
a very, very- pajock.
Hor. You might have rhym'd.
Ham. O good horatio, i'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
pound! Didst perceive?
Hor. Very well, my lord.
Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
Hor. I did very well note him.
Ham. Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
For if the king like not the comedy,
why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
Come, some music!
Enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.
Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
Ham. Sir, a whole history.
Guil. The king, sir-
ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
Ham. With drink, sir?
Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
plunge him into far more choler.
Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
not so wildly from my affair.
Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
Guil. The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
hath sent me to you.
Ham. You are welcome.
Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, i will do
your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business.
Ham. Sir, i cannot.
Guil. What, my lord?
Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
answer is i can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother, you
say-
ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
amazement and admiration.
Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
further trade with us?
Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to
your friend.
Ham. Sir, i lack advancement.
Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself
for your succession in denmark?
Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
musty.
Enter the players with recorders.
O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
into a toil?
Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
Guil. My lord, i cannot.
Ham. I pray you.
Guil. Believe me, i cannot.
Ham. I do beseech you.
Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
Guil. But these cannot i command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
have not the skill.
Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,
excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
speak. 'sblood, do you think i am easier to be play'd on than a
pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
you cannot play upon me.
Enter polonius.
God bless you, sir!
Pol. My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
Ham. Or like a whale.
Pol. Very like a whale.
Ham. Then will i come to my mother by-and-by. - they fool me to the
top of my bent. - i will come by-and-by.
Pol. I will say so. Exit.
Ham. 'by-and-by' is easily said. - leave me, friends.
[exeunt all but hamlet. ]
'tis now the very witching time of night,
when churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
contagion to this world. Now could i drink hot blood
and do such bitter business as the day
would quake to look on. Soft! Now to my mother!
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
the soul of nero enter this firm bosom.
Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
i will speak daggers to her, but use none.
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
how in my words somever she be shent,
to give them seals never, my soul, consent! Exit.
Scene iii.
A room in the castle.
Enter king, rosencrantz, and guildenstern.
King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
to let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
i your commission will forthwith dispatch,
and he to england shall along with you.
The terms of our estate may not endure
hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
out of his lunacies.
Guil. We will ourselves provide.
Most holy and religious fear it is
to keep those many many bodies safe
that live and feed upon your majesty.
Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
with all the strength and armour of the mind
to keep itself from noyance; but much more
that spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
the lives of many. The cesse of majesty
dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
what's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
each small annexment, petty consequence,
attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
King. Arm you, i pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
for we will fetters put upon this fear,
which now goes too free-footed.
Both. We will haste us.
Exeunt gentlemen.
Enter polonius.
Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
Behind the arras i'll convey myself
to hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
and, as you said, and wisely was it said,
'tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
the speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
and tell you what i know.
King. Thanks, dear my lord.
Exit [polonius].
O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
it hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
a brother's murther! Pray can i not,
though inclination be as sharp as will.
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
and, like a man to double business bound,
i stand in pause where i shall first begin,
and both neglect. What if this cursed hand
were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
to wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
but to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
to be forestalled ere we come to fall,
or pardon'd being down? Then i'll look up;
my fault is past. But, o, what form of prayer
can serve my turn? 'forgive me my foul murther'?
That cannot be; since i am still possess'd
of those effects for which i did the murther-
my crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
In the corrupted currents of this world
offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
and oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
There is no shuffling; there the action lies
in his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
to give in evidence. What then? What rests?
Try what repentance can. What can it not?
Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
All may be well. He kneels.
Enter hamlet.
Ham. Now might i do it pat, now he is praying;
and now i'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
and so am i reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
A villain kills my father; and for that,
i, his sole son, do this same villain send
to heaven.
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
He took my father grossly, full of bread,
with all his crimes broad blown, as flush as may;
and how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
'tis heavy with him; and am i then reveng'd,
to take him in the purging of his soul,
when he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
No.
Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
at gaming, swearing, or about some act
that has no relish of salvation in't-
then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
and that his soul may be as damn'd and black
as hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. Exit.
King. [rises] my words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Exit.
Scene iv.
The queen's closet.
Enter queen and polonius.
Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
and that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
Pray you be round with him.
Ham. (within) mother, mother, mother!
Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; i hear him coming.
[polonius hides behind the arras. ]
enter hamlet.
Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
Queen. Why, how now, hamlet?
Ham. What's the matter now?
Queen. Have you forgot me?
Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife,
and (would it were not so! ) you are my mother.
Queen. Nay, then i'll set those to you that can speak.
Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge i
you go not till i set you up a glass
where you may see the inmost part of you.
Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
Help, help, ho!
Pol. [behind] what, ho! Help, help, help!
Ham. [draws] how now? A rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
[makes a pass through the arras and] kills polonius.
Pol. [behind] o, i am slain!
Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
Ham. Nay, i know not. Is it the king?
Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
as kill a king, and marry with his brother.
Queen. As kill a king?
Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
[lifts up the arras and sees polonius. ]
thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! Sit you down
and let me wring your heart; for so i shall
if it be made of penetrable stuff;
if damned custom have not braz'd it so
that it is proof and bulwark against sense.
Queen. What have i done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
in noise so rude against me?
Ham. Such an act
that blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
from the fair forehead of an innocent love,
and sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
as false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
as from the body of contraction plucks
the very soul, and sweet religion makes
a rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
yea, this solidity and compound mass,
with tristful visage, as against the doom,
is thought-sick at the act.
Queen. Ay me, what act,
that roars so loud and thunders in the index?
Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
the counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See what a grace was seated on this brow;
hyperion's curls; the front of jove himself;
an eye like mars, to threaten and command;
a station like the herald mercury
new lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
a combination and a form indeed
where every god did seem to set his seal
to give the world assurance of a man.
This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
and batten on this moor? Ha! Have you eyes
you cannot call it love; for at your age
the heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
and waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
but it reserv'd some quantity of choice
to serve in such a difference. What devil was't
that thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
or but a sickly part of one true sense
could not so mope.
O shame! Where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
if thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
and melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
when the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
since frost itself as actively doth burn,
and reason panders will.
Queen. O hamlet, speak no more!
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
and there i see such black and grained spots
as will not leave their tinct.
Ham. Nay, but to live
in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
over the nasty sty!
Queen. O, speak to me no more!
These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
No more, sweet hamlet!
Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
a cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
that from a shelf the precious diadem stole
and put it in his pocket!
Queen. No more!
Enter the ghost in his nightgown.
Ham. A king of shreds and patches! -
save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
you heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
Queen. Alas, he's mad!
Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
that, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
th' important acting of your dread command?
O, say!
Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
O, step between her and her fighting soul
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Speak to her, hamlet.
Ham. How is it with you, lady?
Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
that you do bend your eye on vacancy,
and with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
and, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
would make them capable. - do not look upon me,
lest with this piteous action you convert
my stern effects. Then what i have to do
will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
Queen. To whom do you speak this?
Ham. Do you see nothing there?
Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is i see.
Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
Exit ghost.
Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
This bodiless creation ecstasy
is very cunning in.
Ham. Ecstasy?
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
and makes as healthful music. It is not madness
that i have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
and i the matter will reword; which madness
would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
lay not that flattering unction to your soul
that not your trespass but my madness speaks.
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
and do not spread the compost on the weeds
to make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
for in the fatness of these pursy times
virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
Queen. O hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
and live the purer with the other half,
good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
that to the use of actions fair and good
he likewise gives a frock or livery,
that aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
and that shall lend a kind of easiness
to the next abstinence; the next more easy;
for use almost can change the stamp of nature,
and either [master] the devil, or throw him out
with wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
and when you are desirous to be blest,
i'll blessing beg of you. - for this same lord,
i do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
to punish me with this, and this with me,
that i must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
the death i gave him. So again, good night.
I must be cruel, only to be kind;
thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
One word more, good lady.
Queen. What shall i do?
Ham. Not this, by no means, that i bid you do:
let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
and let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
make you to ravel all this matter out,
that i essentially am not in madness,
but mad in craft. 'twere good you let him know;
for who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
unpeg the basket on the house's top,
let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
to try conclusions, in the basket creep
and break your own neck down.
Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
and breath of life, i have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me.
Ham. I must to england; you know that?
Queen. Alack,
i had forgot! 'tis so concluded on.
Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
whom i will trust as i will adders fang'd,
they bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
and marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
for 'tis the sport to have the enginer
hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
but i will delve one yard below their mines
and blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
when in one line two crafts directly meet.
This man shall set me packing.
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. -
mother, good night. - indeed, this counsellor
is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
who was in life a foolish peating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night, mother.
[exit the queen. Then] exit hamlet, tugging in
polonius.
Act iv. Scene i.
Elsinore. A room in the castle.
Enter king and queen, with rosencrantz and guildenstern.
King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
you must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?
Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
[exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern. ]
ah, mine own lord, what have i seen to-night!
King. What, gertrude? How does hamlet?
Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
behind the arras hearing something stir,
whips out his rapier, cries 'a rat, a rat! '
and in this brainish apprehension kills
the unseen good old man.
King. O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there.
His liberty is full of threats to all-
to you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
It will be laid to us, whose providence
should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
this mad young man. But so much was our love
we would not understand what was most fit,
but, like the owner of a foul disease,
to keep it from divulging, let it feed
even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
o'er whom his very madness, like some ore
among a mineral of metals base,
shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
King. O gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
but we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
we must with all our majesty and skill
both countenance and excuse. Ho, guildenstern!
Enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.
Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
Hamlet in madness hath polonius slain,
and from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
Exeunt [rosencrantz and guildenstern].
Come, gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
and let them know both what we mean to do
and what's untimely done. [so haply slander-]
whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
as level as the cannon to his blank,
transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
and hit the woundless air. - o, come away!
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
Exeunt.
Scene ii.
Elsinore. A passage in the castle.
Enter hamlet.
Ham. Safely stow'd.
Gentlemen. (within) hamlet! Lord hamlet!
Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on hamlet? O, here they come.
Enter rosencrantz and guildenstern.
Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
and bear it to the chapel.
Ham. Do not believe it.
Ros. Believe what?
Ham. That i can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son
of a king?
Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the king's countenance, his rewards,
his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in
the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have
glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry
again.
Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
the king.
Ham. The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
The king is a thing-
guil. A thing, my lord?
Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
Exeunt.
Scene iii.
Elsinore. A room in the castle.
Enter king.
King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
and where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
but never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
this sudden sending him away must seem
deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
by desperate appliance are reliev'd,
or not at all.
Enter rosencrantz.
How now o what hath befall'n?
Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
we cannot get from him.
King. But where is he?
Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
King. Bring him before us.
Ros. Ho, guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
Enter hamlet and guildenstern [with attendants].
King. Now, hamlet, where's polonius?
Ham. At supper.
King. At supper? Where?
Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and
we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar
is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's the
end.
King. Alas, alas!
Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
King. What dost thou mean by this?
Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
the guts of a beggar.
King. Where is polonius?
Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you
find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
the stair, into the lobby.
King. Go seek him there. [to attendants. ]
ham. He will stay till you come.
[exeunt attendants. ]
king. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety, -
which we do tender as we dearly grieve
for that which thou hast done, - must send thee hence
with fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
The bark is ready and the wind at help,
th' associates tend, and everything is bent
for england.
Ham. For england?
King. Ay, hamlet.
Ham. Good.
King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for england!
Farewell, dear mother.
King. Thy loving father, hamlet.
Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for england!
Exit.
King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
Delay it not; i'll have him hence to-night.
Away! For everything is seal'd and done
that else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
Exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern]
and, england, if my love thou hold'st at aught, -
as my great power thereof may give thee sense,
since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
after the danish sword, and thy free awe
pays homage to us, - thou mayst not coldly set
our sovereign process, which imports at full,
by letters congruing to that effect,
the present death of hamlet. Do it, england;
for like the hectic in my blood he rages,
and thou must cure me. Till i know 'tis done,
howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. Exit.
Scene iv.
Near elsinore.
Enter fortinbras with his army over the stage.
For. Go, captain, from me greet the danish king.
Tell him that by his license fortinbras
craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
If that his majesty would aught with us,
we shall express our duty in his eye;
and let him know so.
Capt. I will do't, my lord.
For. Go softly on.
Exeunt [all but the captain].
Enter hamlet, rosencrantz, [guildenstern, ] and others.
Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
Capt. They are of norway, sir.
Ham. How purpos'd, sir, i pray you?
Capt. Against some part of poland.
Ham. Who commands them, sir?
Capt. The nephew to old norway, fortinbras.
Ham. Goes it against the main of poland, sir,
or for some frontier?
Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
we go to gain a little patch of ground
that hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, i would not farm it;
nor will it yield to norway or the pole
a ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
Ham. Why, then the polack never will defend it.
Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
will not debate the question of this straw.
This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
that inward breaks, and shows no cause without
why the man dies. - i humbly thank you, sir.
Capt. God b' wi' you, sir. [exit. ]
ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
[exeunt all but hamlet. ]
how all occasions do inform against me
and spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
if his chief good and market of his time
be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
looking before and after, gave us not
that capability and godlike reason
to fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
of thinking too precisely on th' event, -
a thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
and ever three parts coward, - i do not know
why yet i live to say 'this thing's to do, '
sith i have cause, and will, and strength, and means
to do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
Witness this army of such mass and charge,
led by a delicate and tender prince,
whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
makes mouths at the invisible event,
exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
is not to stir without great argument,
but greatly to find quarrel in a straw
when honour's at the stake. How stand i then,
that have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
excitements of my reason and my blood,
and let all sleep, while to my shame i see
the imminent death of twenty thousand men
that for a fantasy and trick of fame
go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
which is not tomb enough and continent
to hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
my thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! Exit.
Scene v.
Elsinore. A room in the castle.
Enter horatio, queen, and a gentleman.
Queen. I will not speak with her.
Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
Her mood will needs be pitied.
Queen. What would she have?
Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
there's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
that carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
yet the unshaped use of it doth move
the hearers to collection; they aim at it,
and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
indeed would make one think there might be thought,
though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Hor. 'twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
Queen. Let her come in.
[exit gentleman. ]
[aside] to my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.
So full of artless jealousy is guilt
it spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
Enter ophelia distracted.
Oph. Where is the beauteous majesty of denmark?
Queen. How now, ophelia?
Oph. (sings)
how should i your true-love know
from another one?
By his cockle bat and' staff
and his sandal shoon.
Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Oph. Say you? Nay, pray you mark.
(sings) he is dead and gone, lady,
he is dead and gone;
at his head a grass-green turf,
at his heels a stone.
O, ho!
Queen. Nay, but ophelia-
oph. Pray you mark.
(sings) white his shroud as the mountain snow-
enter king.
Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
Oph. (sings)
larded all with sweet flowers;
which bewept to the grave did not go
with true-love showers.
King. How do you, pretty lady?
Oph. Well, god dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
your table!
King. Conceit upon her father.
Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
it means, say you this:
(sings) to-morrow is saint valentine's day,
all in the morning bedtime,
and i a maid at your window,
to be your valentine.
Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
and dupp'd the chamber door,
let in the maid, that out a maid
never departed more.
King. Pretty ophelia!
Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, i'll make an end on't!
[sings] by gis and by saint charity,
alack, and fie for shame!
Young men will do't if they come to't
by cock, they are to blame.
Quoth she, 'before you tumbled me,
you promis'd me to wed. '
he answers:
'so would i 'a' done, by yonder sun,
an thou hadst not come to my bed. '
king. How long hath she been thus?
Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but i cannot
choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground.
My brother shall know of it; and so i thank you for your good
counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet
ladies. Good night, good night. Exit
king. Follow her close; give her good watch, i pray you.
[exit horatio. ]
o, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
all from her father's death. O gertrude, gertrude,
when sorrows come, they come not single spies.
But in battalions! First, her father slain;
next, your son gone, and he most violent author
of his own just remove; the people muddied,
thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
for good polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
in hugger-mugger to inter him; poor ophelia
divided from herself and her fair-judgment,
without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
last, and as such containing as all these,
her brother is in secret come from france;
and wants not buzzers to infect his ear
feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
with pestilent speeches of his father's death,
wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
will nothing stick our person to arraign
in ear and ear. O my dear gertrude, this,
like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
give, me superfluous death. A noise within.
Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
King. Where are my switzers? Let them guard the door.
Enter a messenger.
What is the matter?
Mess. Save yourself, my lord:
the ocean, overpeering of his list,
eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
than young laertes, in a riotous head,
o'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord;
and, as the world were now but to begin,
antiquity forgot, custom not known,
the ratifiers and props of every word,
they cry 'choose we! Laertes shall be king! '
caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
'laertes shall be king! Laertes king! '
a noise within.
Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
O, this is counter, you false danish dogs!
King. The doors are broke.
Enter laertes with others.
Laer. Where is this king? - sirs, staid you all without.
All. No, let's come in!
Laer. I pray you give me leave.
All. We will, we will!
Laer. I thank you. Keep the door. [exeunt his followers. ]
o thou vile king,
give me my father!
Queen. Calmly, good laertes.
Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
of my true mother.
King. What is the cause, laertes,
that thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
Let him go, gertrude. Do not fear our person.
There's such divinity doth hedge a king
that treason can but peep to what it would,
acts little of his will. Tell me, laertes,
why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, gertrude.
Speak, man.
Laer. Where is my father?
King. Dead.
Queen. But not by him!
King. Let him demand his fill.
Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
to hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil
conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation. To this point i stand,
that both the world, i give to negligence,
let come what comes; only i'll be reveng'd
most throughly for my father.
King. Who shall stay you?
Laer. My will, not all the world!
And for my means, i'll husband them so well
they shall go far with little.
King. Good laertes,
if you desire to know the certainty
of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
winner and loser?
Laer. None but his enemies.
King. Will you know them then?
Laer. To his good friends thus wide i'll ope my arms
and, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
repast them with my blood.
King. Why, now you speak
like a good child and a true gentleman.
That i am guiltless of your father's death,
and am most sensibly in grief for it,
it shall as level to your judgment pierce
as day does to your eye.
A noise within: 'let her come in. '
laer. How now? What noise is that?
Enter ophelia.
O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
till our scale turn the beam. O rose of may!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet ophelia!
O heavens! Is't possible a young maid's wits
should be as mortal as an old man's life?
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
it sends some precious instance of itself
after the thing it loves.
Oph. (sings)
they bore him barefac'd on the bier
(hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
and in his grave rain'd many a tear.
Fare you well, my dove!
Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
it could not move thus.
Oph. You must sing 'a-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a. ' o,
how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
master's daughter.
Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' sundays.
O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father
died. They say he made a good end.
[sings] for bonny sweet robin is all my joy.
Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
she turns to favour and to prettiness.
Oph. (sings)
and will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead;
go to thy deathbed;
he never will come again.
His beard was as white as snow,
all flaxen was his poll.
He is gone, he is gone,
and we cast away moan.
God 'a'mercy on his soul!
And of all christian souls, i pray god. God b' wi', you.
Exit.
Laer. Do you see this, o god?
King. Laertes, i must commune with your grief,
or you deny me right. Go but apart,
make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
and they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
If by direct or by collateral hand
they find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
to you in satisfaction; but if not,
be you content to lend your patience to us,
and we shall jointly labour with your soul
to give it due content.
Laer. Let this be so.
His means of death, his obscure funeral-
no trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
no noble rite nor formal ostentation, -
cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
that i must call't in question.
King. So you shall;
and where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
I pray you go with me.
Exeunt
scene vi.
Elsinore. Another room in the castle.
Enter horatio with an attendant.
Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
Hor. Let them come in.
[exit attendant. ]
i do not know from what part of the world
i should be greeted, if not from lord hamlet.
Enter sailors.
Sailor. God bless you, sir.
Hor. Let him bless thee too.
Sailor. 'a shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
sir, - it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for england- if
your name be horatio, as i am let to know it is.
Hor. (reads the letter) 'horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
this, give these fellows some means to the king. They have
letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of
very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple i
boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so i
alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
of mercy; but they knew what they did: i am to do a good turn for
them. Let the king have the letters i have sent, and repair thou
to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
thee where i am. Rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course
for england. Of them i have much to tell thee. Farewell.
'he that thou knowest thine, hamlet. '
come, i will give you way for these your letters,
and do't the speedier that you may direct me
to him from whom you brought them. Exeunt.
Scene vii.
Elsinore. Another room in the castle.
Enter king and laertes.
King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
and you must put me in your heart for friend,
sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
that he which hath your noble father slain
pursued my life.
Laer. It well appears. But tell me
why you proceeded not against these feats
so crimeful and so capital in nature,
as by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
you mainly were stirr'd up.
King. O, for two special reasons,
which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
but yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
lives almost by his looks; and for myself, -
my virtue or my plague, be it either which, -
she's so conjunctive to my life and soul
that, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
i could not but by her. The other motive
why to a public count i might not go
is the great love the general gender bear him,
who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
would have reverted to my bow again,
and not where i had aim'd them.
Laer. And so have i a noble father lost;
a sister driven into desp'rate terms,
whose worth, if praises may go back again,
stood challenger on mount of all the age
for her perfections. But my revenge will come.
King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
that we are made of stuff so flat and dull
that we can let our beard be shook with danger,
and think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
and that, i hope, will teach you to imagine-
enter a messenger with letters.
How now? What news?
Mess. Letters, my lord, from hamlet:
this to your majesty; this to the queen.
King. From hamlet? Who brought them?
Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; i saw them not.
They were given me by claudio; he receiv'd them
of him that brought them.
King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us.
Exit messenger.
[reads]'high and mighty, -you shall know i am set naked on your
kingdom. To-morrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
when i shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
'hamlet. '
what should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
Laer. Know you the hand?
King. 'tis hamlet's character. 'naked! '
and in a postscript here, he says 'alone. '
can you advise me?
Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
It warms the very sickness in my heart
that i shall live and tell him to his teeth,
'thus didest thou. '
king. If it be so, laertes
(as how should it be so? How otherwise? ),
will you be rul'd by me?
Laer. Ay my lord,
so you will not o'errule me to a peace.
King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
as checking at his voyage, and that he means
no more to undertake it, i will work him
to exploit now ripe in my device,
under the which he shall not choose but fall;
and for his death no wind
but even his mother shall uncharge the practice
and call it accident.
Laer. My lord, i will be rul'd;
the rather, if you could devise it so
that i might be the organ.
King. It falls right.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
and that in hamlet's hearing, for a quality
wherein they say you shine, your sun of parts
did not together pluck such envy from him
as did that one; and that, in my regard,
of the unworthiest siege.
Laer. What part is that, my lord?
King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
the light and careless livery that it wears
thin settled age his sables and his weeds,
importing health and graveness. Two months since
here was a gentleman of normandy.
I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the french,
and they can well on horseback; but this gallant
had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
and to such wondrous doing brought his horse
as had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
with the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
that i, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
come short of what he did.
Laer. A norman was't?
King. A norman.
Laer. Upon my life, lamound.
King. The very same.
Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
and gem of all the nation.
King. He made confession of you;
and gave you such a masterly report
for art and exercise in your defence,
and for your rapier most especially,
that he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
if one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
he swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
if you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
did hamlet so envenom with his envy
that he could nothing do but wish and beg
your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
Now, out of this-
laer. What out of this, my lord?
King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
a face without a heart, '
laer. Why ask you this?
King. Not that i think you did not love your father;
but that i know love is begun by time,
and that i see, in passages of proof,
time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
There lives within the very flame of love
a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
and nothing is at a like goodness still;
for goodness, growing to a plurisy,
dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
we should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
and hath abatements and delays as many
as there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
and then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
that hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
to show yourself your father's son in deed
more than in words?
Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
revenge should have no bounds. But, good laertes,
will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
Will return'd shall know you are come home.
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
and set a double varnish on the fame
the frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
and wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
most generous, and free from all contriving,
will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
or with a little shuffling, you may choose
a sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
requite him for your father.
Laer. I will do't!
And for that purpose i'll anoint my sword.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
so mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
collected from all simples that have virtue
under the moon, can save the thing from death
this is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
with this contagion, that, if i gall him slightly,
it may be death.
King. Let's further think of this,
weigh what convenience both of time and means
may fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
and that our drift look through our bad performance.
'twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
should have a back or second, that might hold
if this did blast in proof. Soft! Let me see.
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
i ha't!
When in your motion you are hot and dry-
as make your bouts more violent to that end-
and that he calls for drink, i'll have prepar'd him
a chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
if he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
our purpose may hold there. - but stay, what noise,
enter queen.
How now, sweet queen?
Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
so fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, laertes.
Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
There with fantastic garlands did she come
of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
that liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
when down her weedy trophies and herself
fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
and, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
as one incapable of her own distress,
or like a creature native and indued
unto that element; but long it could not be
till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
to muddy death.
Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor ophelia,
and therefore i forbid my tears; but yet
it is our trick; nature her custom holds,
let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
the woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
but that this folly douts it. Exit.
King. Let's follow, gertrude.
How much i had to do to calm his rage i
now fear i this will give it start again;
therefore let's follow.
Exeunt.
Act v. Scene i.
Elsinore. A churchyard.
Enter two clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].
Clown. Is she to be buried in christian burial when she wilfully
seeks her own salvation?
Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it christian burial.
Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
defence?
Other. Why, 'tis found so.
Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
the point: if i drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and an
act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
Other. Nay, but hear you, goodman delver!
Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the
man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to
him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
Other. But is this law?
Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' christian burial.
Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk
should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves
more than their even-christen. Come, my spade! There is no
ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They
hold up adam's profession.
Other. Was he a gentleman?
Clown. 'a was the first that ever bore arms.
Other. Why, he had none.
Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the scripture?
The scripture says adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself-
other. Go to!
Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
shipwright, or the carpenter?
Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand
tenants.
Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well.
But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!
Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
carpenter?
Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Other. Marry, now i can tell!
Clown. To't.
Other. Mass, i cannot tell.
Enter hamlet and horatio afar off.
Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
question next, say 'a grave-maker. ' the houses he makes lasts
till doomsday. Go, get thee to yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
liquor.
[exit second clown. ]
[clown digs and] sings.
In youth when i did love, did love,
methought it was very sweet;
to contract- o- the time for- a- my behove,
o, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
grave-making?
Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
Ham. 'tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
sense.
Clown. (sings)
but age with his stealing steps
hath clawed me in his clutch,
and hath shipped me intil the land,
as if i had never been such.
[throws up a skull. ]
ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
knave jowls it to the ground, as if 'twere cain's jawbone, that
did the first murther! This might be the pate of a politician,
which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent god,
might it not?
Hor. It might, my lord.
Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'good morrow, sweet lord!
How dost thou, good lord? ' this might be my lord such-a-one, that
prais'd my lord such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it- might
it not?
Hor. Ay, my lord.
Ham. Why, e'en so! And now my lady worm's, chapless, and knock'd
about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,
and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
on't.
Clown. (sings)
a pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
for and a shrouding sheet;
o, a pit of clay for to be made
for such a guest is meet.
Throws up [another skull].
Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a
great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of
his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no
more, ha?
Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Hor. Ay, my lord, and of calveskins too.
Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
Clown. Mine, sir.
[sings] o, a pit of clay for to be made
for such a guest is meet.
Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
For my part, i do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'tis for
the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
Clown. 'tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
Clown. For no man, sir.
Ham. What woman then?
Clown. For none neither.
Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
equivocation will undo us. By the lord, horatio, this three years
i have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe
of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
his kibe. - how long hast thou been a grave-maker?
Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, i came to't that day that our
last king hamlet overcame fortinbras.
Ham. How long is that since?
Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the
very day that young hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
into england.
Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into england?
Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'a shall recover his wits there;
or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
Ham. Why?
Clown. 'twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as mad as
he.
Ham. How came he mad?
Clown. Very strangely, they say.
Ham. How strangely?
Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
Ham. Upon what ground?
Clown. Why, here in denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy
thirty years.
Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many
pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in, i
will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
you nine year.
Ham. Why he more than another?
Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will
keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien
you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
Ham. Whose was it?
Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it was?
Ham. Nay, i know not.
Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of
rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was yorick's
skull, the king's jester.
Ham. This?
Clown. E'en that.
Ham. Let me see. [takes the skull. ] alas, poor yorick! I knew him,
horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred
in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
lips that i have kiss'd i know not how oft. Where be your gibes
now? Your gambols? Your songs? Your flashes of merriment that
were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, horatio,
tell me one thing.
Hor. What's that, my lord?
Ham. Dost thou think alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
Hor. E'en so.
Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
[puts down the skull. ]
hor. E'en so, my lord.
Ham. To what base uses we may return, horatio! Why may not
imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it
stopping a bunghole?
Hor. 'twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: alexander died,
alexander was buried, alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he
was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
Imperious caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
But soft! But soft! Aside! Here comes the king-
enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], king,
queen, laertes, with lords attendant. ]
the queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
the corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
fordo it own life. 'twas of some estate.
Couch we awhile, and mark.
[retires with horatio. ]
laer. What ceremony else?
Ham. That is laertes,
a very noble youth. Mark.
Laer. What ceremony else?
Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
as we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
and, but that great command o'ersways the order,
she should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
of bell and burial.
Laer. Must there no more be done?
Priest. No more be done.
We should profane the service of the dead
to sing a requiem and such rest to her
as to peace-parted souls.
Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
a minist'ring angel shall my sister be
when thou liest howling.
Ham. What, the fair ophelia?
Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
[scatters flowers. ]
i hop'd thou shouldst have been my hamlet's wife;
i thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
and not have strew'd thy grave.
Laer. O, treble woe
fall ten times treble on that cursed head
whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
till i have caught her once more in mine arms.
Leaps in the grave.
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
till of this flat a mountain you have made
t' o'ertop old pelion or the skyish head
of blue olympus.
Ham. [comes forward] what is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis? Whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
like wonder-wounded hearers? This is i,
hamlet the dane. [leaps in after laertes.
Laer. The devil take thy soul!
[grapples with him].
Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
for, though i am not splenitive and rash,
yet have i in me something dangerous,
which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
King. Pluck thein asunder.
Queen. Hamlet, hamlet!
All. Gentlemen!
Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
[the attendants part them, and they come out of the
grave. ]
ham. Why, i will fight with him upon this theme
until my eyelids will no longer wag.
Queen. O my son, what theme?
Ham. I lov'd ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
could not (with all their quantity of love)
make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
King. O, he is mad, laertes.
Queen. For love of god, forbear him!
Ham. 'swounds, show me what thou't do.
Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't fast? Woo't tear thyself?
Woo't drink up esill? Eat a crocodile?
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and so will i.
And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
millions of acres on us, till our ground,
singeing his pate against the burning zone,
make ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
i'll rant as well as thou.
Queen. This is mere madness;
and thus a while the fit will work on him.
Anon, as patient as the female dove
when that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
his silence will sit drooping.
Ham. Hear you, sir!
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
Let hercules himself do what he may,
the cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
Exit.
King. I pray thee, good horatio, wait upon him.
Exit horatio.
[to laertes] strengthen your patience in our last night's speech.
We'll put the matter to the present push. -
good gertrude, set some watch over your son. -
this grave shall have a living monument.
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
till then in patience our proceeding be.
Exeunt.
Scene ii.
Elsinore. A hall in the castle.
Enter hamlet and horatio.
Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
You do remember all the circumstance?
Hor. Remember it, my lord!
Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
that would not let me sleep. Methought i lay
worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
and prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
our indiscretion sometime serves us well
when our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
there's a divinity that shapes our ends,
rough-hew them how we will-
hor. That is most certain.
Ham. Up from my cabin,
my sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
grop'd i to find out them; had my desire,
finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
to mine own room again; making so bold
(my fears forgetting manners) to unseal
their grand commission; where i found, horatio
(o royal knavery! ), an exact command,
larded with many several sorts of reasons,
importing denmark's health, and england's too,
with, hoo! Such bugs and goblins in my life-
that, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
no, not to stay the finding of the axe,
my head should be struck off.
Hor. Is't possible?
Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou bear me how i did proceed?
Hor. I beseech you.
Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
or i could make a prologue to my brains,
they had begun the play. I sat me down;
devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
a baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
how to forget that learning; but, sir, now
it did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
th' effect of what i wrote?
Hor. Ay, good my lord.
Ham. An earnest conjuration from the king,
as england was his faithful tributary,
as love between them like the palm might flourish,
as peace should still her wheaten garland wear
and stand a comma 'tween their amities,
and many such-like as's of great charge,
that, on the view and knowing of these contents,
without debatement further, more or less,
he should the bearers put to sudden death,
not shriving time allow'd.
Hor. How was this seal'd?
Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
which was the model of that danish seal;
folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
the changeling never known. Now, the next day
was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
thou know'st already.
Hor. So guildenstern and rosencrantz go to't.
Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
does by their own insinuation grow.
'tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
between the pass and fell incensed points
of mighty opposites.
Hor. Why, what a king is this!
Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
he that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
thrown out his angle for my proper life,
and with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
to quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
to let this canker of our nature come
in further evil?
Hor. It must be shortly known to him from england
what is the issue of the business there.
Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
and a man's life is no more than to say 'one. '
but i am very sorry, good horatio,
that to laertes i forgot myself,
for by the image of my cause i see
the portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
into a tow'ring passion.
Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
Enter young osric, a courtier.
Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to denmark.
Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [aside to horatio] dost know this
waterfly?
Hor. [aside to hamlet] no, my good lord.
Ham. [aside to horatio] thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be
lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'tis
a chough; but, as i say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, i should impart
a thing to you from his majesty.
Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
bonnet to his right use. 'tis for the head.
Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- i cannot
tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that
he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter-
ham. I beseech you remember.
[hamlet moves him to put on his hat. ]
osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
newly come to court laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,
full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of
what part a gentleman would see.
Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, i
know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of
memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
But, in the verity of extolment, i take him to be a soul of great
article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
rawer breath
osr. Sir?
Hor [aside to hamlet] is't not possible to understand in another
tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
osr. Of laertes?
Hor. [aside] his purse is empty already. All's golden words are
spent.
Ham. Of him, sir.
Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
much approve me. Well, sir?
Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is-
ham. I dare not confess that, lest i should compare with him in
excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
Ham. What's his weapon?
Osr. Rapier and dagger.
Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
Osr. The king, sir, hath wager'd with him six barbary horses;
against the which he has impon'd, as i take it, six french
rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
very liberal conceit.
Ham. What call you the carriages?
Hor. [aside to hamlet] i knew you must be edified by the margent
ere you had done.
Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.
But on! Six barbary horses against six french swords, their
assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the french
bet against the danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?
Osr. The king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
Ham. How if i answer no?
Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
Ham. Sir, i will walk here in the hall. If it please his majesty,
it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,
i will win for him if i can; if not, i will gain nothing but my
shame and the odd hits.
Osr. Shall i redeliver you e'en so?
Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
Ham. Yours, yours. [exit osric. ] he does well to commend it
himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes
on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-
a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
enter a lord.
Lord. My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young osric, who
brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes, or that you will
take longer time.
Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure.
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
i be so able as now.
Lord. The king and queen and all are coming down.
Ham. In happy time.
Lord. The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
laertes before you fall to play.
Ham. She well instructs me.
[exit lord. ]
hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into france i have been in
continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
Hor. Nay, good my lord -
ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
would perhaps trouble a woman.
Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
repair hither and say you are not fit.
Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be
not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,
what is't to leave betimes? Let be.
Enter king, queen, laertes, osric, and lords, with other
attendants with foils and gauntlets.
A table and flagons of wine on it.
King. Come, hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
[the king puts laertes' hand into hamlet's. ]
ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
but pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows,
and you must needs have heard, how i am punish'd
with sore distraction. What i have done
that might your nature, honour, and exception
roughly awake, i here proclaim was madness.
Was't hamlet wrong'd laertes? Never hamlet.
If hamlet from himself be taken away,
and when he's not himself does wrong laertes,
then hamlet does it not, hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
his madness is poor hamlet's enemy.
Sir, in this audience,
let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
free me so far in your most generous thoughts
that i have shot my arrow o'er the house
and hurt my brother.
Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
whose motive in this case should stir me most
to my revenge. But in my terms of honour
i stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
till by some elder masters of known honour
i have a voice and precedent of peace
to keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
i do receive your offer'd love like love,
and will not wrong it.
Ham. I embrace it freely,
and will this brother's wager frankly play.
Give us the foils. Come on.
Laer. Come, one for me.
Ham. I'll be your foil, laertes. In mine ignorance
your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
stick fiery off indeed.
Laer. You mock me, sir.
Ham. No, by this bad.
King. Give them the foils, young osric. Cousin hamlet,
you know the wager?
Ham. Very well, my lord.
Your grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
King. I do not fear it, i have seen you both;
but since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
Prepare to play.
Osr. Ay, my good lord.
King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If hamlet give the first or second hit,
or quit in answer of the third exchange,
let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath,
and in the cup an union shall he throw
richer than that which four successive kings
in denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
and let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
the trumpet to the cannoneer without,
the cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
'now the king drinks to hamlet. ' come, begin.
And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
Ham. Come on, sir.
Laer. Come, my lord. They play.
Ham. One.
Laer. No.
Ham. Judgment!
Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
Laer. Well, again!
King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
here's to thy health.
[drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
Give him the cup.
Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
Come. (they play. ) another hit. What say you?
Laer. A touch, a touch; i do confess't.
King. Our son shall win.
Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
The queen carouses to thy fortune, hamlet.
Ham. Good madam!
King. Gertrude, do not drink.
Queen. I will, my lord; i pray you pardon me. Drinks.
King. [aside] it is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
Laer. My lord, i'll hit him now.
King. I do not think't.
Laer. [aside] and yet it is almost against my conscience.
Ham. Come for the third, laertes! You but dally.
Pray you pass with your best violence;
i am afeard you make a wanton of me.
Laer. Say you so? Come on. Play.
Osr. Nothing neither way.
Laer. Have at you now!
[laertes wounds hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
change rapiers, [and hamlet wounds laertes].
King. Part them! They are incens'd.
Ham. Nay come! Again! The queen falls.
Osr. Look to the queen there, ho!
Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
Osr. How is't, laertes?
Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, osric.
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
Ham. How does the queen?
King. She sounds to see them bleed.
Queen. No, no! The drink, the drink! O my dear hamlet!
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. [dies. ]
ham. O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock'd.
Treachery! Seek it out.
[laertes falls. ]
laer. It is here, hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
no medicine in the world can do thee good.
In thee there is not half an hour of life.
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here i lie,
never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
I can no more. The king, the king's to blame.
Ham. The point envenom'd too?
Then, venom, to thy work. Hurts the king.
All. Treason! Treason!
King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned dane,
drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
Follow my mother. King dies.
Laer. He is justly serv'd.
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble hamlet.
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
nor thine on me! Dies.
Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
I am dead, horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
that are but mutes or audience to this act,
had i but time (as this fell sergeant, death,
is strict in his arrest) o, i could tell you-
but let it be. Horatio, i am dead;
thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
to the unsatisfied.
Hor. Never believe it.
I am more an antique roman than a dane.
Here's yet some liquor left.
Ham. As th'art a man,
give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, i'll ha't.
O good horatio, what a wounded name
(things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
absent thee from felicity awhile,
and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
to tell my story. [march afar off, and shot within. ]
what warlike noise is this?
Osr. Young fortinbras, with conquest come from poland,
to the ambassadors of england gives
this warlike volley.
Ham. O, i die, horatio!
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
I cannot live to hear the news from england,
but i do prophesy th' election lights
on fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
which have solicited- the rest is silence. Dies.
Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
[march within. ]
why does the drum come hither?
Enter fortinbras and english ambassadors, with drum,
colours, and attendants.
Fort. Where is this sight?
Hor. What is it you will see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
what feast is toward in thine eternal cell
that thou so many princes at a shot
so bloodily hast struck.
Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
and our affairs from england come too late.
The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
to tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead.
Where should we have our thanks?
Hor. Not from his mouth,
had it th' ability of life to thank you.
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
you from the polack wars, and you from england,
are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
high on a stage be placed to the view;
and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
how these things came about. So shall you hear
of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
and, in this upshot, purposes mistook
fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can i
truly deliver.
Fort. Let us haste to hear it,
and call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow i embrace my fortune.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
Hor. Of that i shall have also cause to speak,
and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
But let this same be presently perform'd,
even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
on plots and errors happen.
Fort. Let four captains
bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
for he was likely, had he been put on,
to have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
the soldiers' music and the rites of war
speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
are shot off.
The end
